A campaign can also recognize and honor those resisters who have been imprisoned for the cause—singling them out for respect.
In this way the campaign can invert and subvert the government-promoted convention that makes jailbirds objects of shame.

## Women’s Tax Resistance League

The Women’s Tax Resistance League made a point of honoring those who had done time for the movement.
An American woman who visited her counterparts across the ocean observed:

> It was a queer sensation in those days to look upon sweet and ladylike young women… and to know that they had actually been prisoners. It was not long before they were looked upon as something sacred, as those who had made special sacrifices for the cause, and they wore badges to show that they had been prisoners and in every place were given the post of honor until their numbers mounted up to the hundreds.

## Beidenfleth Farmers

I mentioned earlier the case of farmers in Beidenfleth who were eagerly trying to get themselves indicted for tax resistance (see [Take Other Forms of Mass Action in Response to Arrests](../massresponsetoarrests/)).
Those who succeeded were honored:

> The Beidenfleth Heifer Case developed into a regular popular festival. Maidenly hands strung garlands about the necks of those enviable peasants who had achieved the honour of receiving a writ.
