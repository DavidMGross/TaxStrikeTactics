The heart of a tax resistance campaign is the resisters themselves.
A successful campaign encourages, supports, and sustains these resisters, and facilitates their resistance.
This chapter discusses some of the techniques campaigns rely on for this.

Tactics in this category are also opportunities for people who are sympathetic to the campaign but who are unable to resist paying taxes themselves.
People who cannot resist taxes directly can help support those who can and do.
