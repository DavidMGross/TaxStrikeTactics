The heart of any tax resistance campaign is the resisters themselves.
A successful campaign does what it can to encourage, support, and sustain these resisters and to facilitate their resistance.
This chapter discusses some of the techniques campaigns have relied on for this.

Tactics in this category can also be opportunities for people who are sympathetic to the campaign, but who are nonetheless unable to resist paying taxes themselves.
People who cannot resist the tax directly can help support those who can and do.
