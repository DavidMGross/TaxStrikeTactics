Simply expressing “I’m with you,” “I’m on your side,” “I’m proud of what you’re doing” can keep a resister going when things get tough.

Amish tax resister Valentine Byler was in the fields plowing when the IRS came and seized his horses and harnesses.
He had refused to pay into the government’s social security system, believing that to participate in such an insurance program would be unchristian.
Americans across the country who were furious that the government seized a man’s livelihood to force him to adhere to its social welfare program sent Byler messages of support like these:

> “I congratulate you on having the intestinal fortitude to stand up for your beliefs.”

> “Your courageous stand for your religious principles is to be commended.”

> “I am sincerely sorry this has happened.”

Sympathizers can also take bolder steps to show their solidarity.
In 1952, when the Wyoming Conference of the Methodist Church dismissed Rev. Richard Fichter for being a war tax resister, another minister, James Garst, resigned from the Conference in protest.

At its biannual national meetings, the American war tax resistance group called the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee (NWTRCC) makes a point of asking attendees to sign cards of sympathy and encouragement to be sent to war tax resisters who have recently suffered repercussions from their resistance.
