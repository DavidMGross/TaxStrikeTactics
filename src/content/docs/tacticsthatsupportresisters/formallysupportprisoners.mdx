Another way of expressing support for imprisoned tax resisters is with public, formal commendations.

## <Badge text="Example" size="medium" /> Zerah C. Whipple

For example, when Zerah C. Whipple was in jail for his war tax resistance, the Connecticut State Peace Society passed a whole series of resolutions in support.
One read:

> Resolved: That it is a great, precious, and sanctifying privilege of us all, to feel that in his bonds we are bound with him, and to pour our heart’s holiest sympathies into his cup of trial.

## <Badge text="Example" size="medium" /> Railroad Bond Shenanigans

Judge E.T. Lane of Cass County, Missouri, went to prison in 1892 rather than obey a higher court’s order that he impose a tax on County citizens to pay for corruptly-issued railroad bonds.
Grateful citizens showed their appreciation for his stand by nominating him for the legislature, and then electing him by an overwhelming margin while he was still behind bars.
This particular honor had a very practical effect:
Because Lane could not legally serve both as a judge and as a legislative representative at the same time, upon winning the election his term as judge ended, which meant that he could no longer be held in contempt for refusing to obey an order he was no longer empowered to obey.
