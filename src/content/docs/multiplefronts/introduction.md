Your tax resistance campaign is most likely to be successful if it grows beyond simply advocating and practicing some form of tax resistance.
That is only one of the fronts on which a tax resistance struggle takes place, and a successful campaign will have strategies to address each of these fronts:

**Support Tax Resisters**
: If tax resistance were easy, everybody would do it.
  A government doesn’t stay in the governing business for long unless it is capable of making life difficult for people who refuse to cough up the demanded tribute.

: For this reason, enthusiasm and righteous anger are usually not enough to keep a tax resistance campaign going.
  A successful campaign will take concrete steps to provide practical and moral support to resisters so that they’ll keep resisting when things get tough.

**Increase the Number of Resisters**
: In general, the more people you can get to resist, the better it is for your campaign.
  New resisters increase the impact of the resistance, give the government more headaches, and increase the credibility of your campaign’s threat to the status quo.

: A successful tax resistance campaign will make it easy and attractive for new people to begin resisting, and will slow the rate of attrition of existing resisters.

**Frustrate Government Countermeasures**
: The government will respond to a threatening tax resistance campaign by attacking the movement itself and by taking reprisals against individual resisters as a way of discouraging the others.
  There are a number of ways successful tax resistance campaigns have made it more difficult for the government to pursue such countermeasures.

**Expand the Arsenal of Resistance Techniques**
: Continually developing new tax resistance techniques has many advantages:
  It can make your resistance more effective by increasing the amount of money withheld from the government.
  It can attract new people to the movement by enabling people who could not resist in one way to resist in a new way.
  And, by introducing new resistance techniques faster than the government can enact new ways of discouraging the old ones, it can make the government play a frustrating game of “whack-a-mole.”

**Education and Public Relations**
: By taking charge of your campaign’s image and message, you can help it be more persuasive to the population as a whole or to people in positions of influence, and you can educate people about the techniques and consequences of resistance, which helps in your recruitment efforts.

**Lay the Groundwork for Victory**
: As you develop your campaign, be sure to spend some time picturing what victory will look like and thinking about how you’ll preserve it once you’ve won it.
  A successful tax resistance campaign doesn’t necessarily end with a showy flag-raising—it’s often more subtle than that.

In the following chapters, I’ll show you examples of tactics that have been used by tax resistance campaigns from around the world and throughout history to expand their struggles on each of these fronts.
In a final chapter, I’ll also discuss how solitary tax resisters can also be successful on their own terms.

But first I’d like to consider some more general concerns about activism and dissent.
