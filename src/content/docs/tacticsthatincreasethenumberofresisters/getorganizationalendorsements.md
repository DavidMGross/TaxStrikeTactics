If you can convince influential organizations to endorse tax resistance or to recommend that their members begin resisting, this can be a great boost to your campaign.
Here are a few examples:

## Queensland’s LPAs

An existing network of “Local Producers’ Associations” was crucial to the mass-adoption of tax resistance by agriculturalists in Queensland, Australia, in 1927 and to the success of their tax resistance campaign.
The Associations used their preexisting communication and organizing infrastructure to call meetings, create an information-sharing network across Queensland, and coordinate policies.
This allowed them to put forward a bold and united tax resistance front so quickly and convincingly that their campaign succeeded in convincing the government to rescind its water tax after only a month.

## The British Women’s Suffrage Movement

The women’s suffrage movement in the United Kingdom was not unified.
There were tactical, ideological, and personal divides that fragmented the movement into several groups.
The Women’s Freedom League was an early adopter of the tactic of tax resistance, in 1908, and in 1909 it spun off a sub-group—the Women’s Tax Resistance League—devoted to that tactic.
This spin-off group tried to be ecumenical, accepting into its ranks activists from various factions, and trying in turn to spread the tactic of tax resistance to the various groups that made up the suffrage movement.
The gambit worked:
In 1910 they won the endorsement of the Women’s Social and Political Union, and in 1913 that of the Federated Council of Suffrage Societies.

## Quakers

Since the founding of the Society of Friends, it had a policy of instructing members to refuse to pay government-mandated tithes to rival churches.
This policy of refusal to pay for things that offend God soon extended to war tax resistance.
Quakers were instructed not to pay taxes for “drums, colors, or for other warlike uses” and not to pay fines that the government assessed for their refusal to participate in the military.

Quaker meetings would codify policies like these in a book of “discipline.”
Any Quakers who deviated from these policies would be subject to a process of correction, or, if they continued to defy the policy, “disowning” (something akin to excommunication).
Here is one example of a Quaker policy on war tax resistance, from the rules of discipline of the Rhode Island Yearly Meeting:

> It is the concern of this meeting, to recommend to the several monthly meetings, that they, consistently with our ancient testimony, refuse the payment of all taxes, expressly or specially for the support of war, whether called for in money, provisions, or otherwise… and that such friends as do actively pay such taxes, be dealt with as disorderly walkers.

Such rules of discipline might change over time, and could differ from meeting to meeting.
Heated argument might break out about how strict a standard of tax resistance Quakers should be held to.
This frequent debate helped to maintain awareness of tax resistance in the Society.

## Peace Churches

In 1978 three American “peace church” denominations—Quakers, Brethren, and Mennonites—issued a rare joint statement that called for war tax resistance among their 350,000 church members, and asked their congregations to “uphold war tax resisters with spiritual, emotional, legal, and material support.”
