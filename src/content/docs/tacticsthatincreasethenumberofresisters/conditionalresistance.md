Some tax resistance movements have designed campaigns in which people take pledges to begin resisting taxes as a group once a certain critical mass of people also take the pledge.

This can have several advantages.
For one thing, it’s human nature that people may be afraid to take an action by themselves that they would not find so frightening if they were to do it along with a large group of people.

People may also be reluctant to resist because they feel that unless a large number of people were to resist, their own tax resistance would be practically ineffective.
By waiting for a critical mass, you help ensure such skeptical resisters that their resistance will be valuable and effective.

Also, by waiting to resist until a critical mass of resisters is available, you may be more able to overwhelm your opponents’ defenses, and so your resistance may be more effective.

## South African Miners

Miners at the “New Rush” in Kimberly, South Africa in 1874 signed a pledge of tax resistance, mutual protection, and boycott of non-resisters, that included a minimum-signers trigger:

> This pledge is to become operative, and shall be enforced, when signed by 400 men.… This pledge is a serious matter. If it is passed to-night it will only be a Resolution; but as soon as it is signed by 400 men, which will most likely be on Monday next, it will be the law of the people which must be abided by and ruthlessly enforced.

## American Women’s Suffragist Activists

Women’s suffrage activists in Wisconsin in 1903 created a tax resistance pledge of this sort, and said “when 10,000 names have been secured to a pledge, the women will refuse to pay taxes, and the questions involved will be taken to the courts.”
Another version of the pledge put the number at 5,000 and made it a little more vague just what they were pledging themselves to:

> We, the tax paying women of Wisconsin, hereby agree to do what we can by protest and argument to emphasize the fact that taxation without representation is tyranny as much for American women today as it was for American colonists in 1778. And we also pledge ourselves that when 5,000 or more women in Wisconsin shall have similarly enrolled we will simultaneously take action by whatever method may seem best in accordance with official advice from the Wisconsin Suffrage Association to the end that public attention may be thoroughly and effectively called to the injustice and injury done to women by taxing them without giving them any voice as to how their money should be employed.

## American War Tax Resisters

The American anti-war activist group Code Pink launched a campaign called “Don’t Buy Bush’s War” in 2007:

> When there are 100,000 of us who have the courage to pledge no more money for war, we will join in an act of mass civil disobedience and refuse to pay the portion of our taxes that represents the % we spend on the U.S. military occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.

The campaign’s ambitions were a little too high, as it turns out, but they did get over 2,000 pledges, and started many conversations about war tax resistance among anti-war activists, so the effort may not have been for naught.
