You can withhold resources from the government by making your economic transactions less easily traceable: for instance by using cash instead of checks, bank transfers, or credit cards.

When you pay with cash, you make it easier for the recipient to evade taxes on the income or sale.
Although the government can respond to this by raising the tax rate on the people it does catch in its net, that approach diminishes taxpayer morale and increases the financial incentive for evasion, which can make the government’s problem worse on the whole.

In Greece, for example, restaurants and bars will often simply tell patrons the amount of the bill rather than writing up a formal receipt.
Then, if the patrons pay in cash, the businesses will pocket the money but never put the transaction on the books and never pay taxes on the earnings.
The government of Greece responded to this form of evasion by telling patrons that they would not be obligated to pay a bill unless it came in the form of a paper receipt—they could just walk out the door with a free lunch, legally.
Fortunately, the social norms against cheating people who feed you are pretty strong, and patrons so far seem to be more inclined to continue to help assist tax evading businesses than to get government-approved freebies at their expense.

An anonymous ex-waiter in the United States explained one way you can help wait staff in that country who want to lower their taxes.
When reporting tips to the government, he says, restaurants look at the tips that were reported on those receipts that were paid for by credit card to determine an average tip.
They then apply this average to all of the tables—cash and credit—that were served by a particular waiter:
“They look at the charged meals, look at the number of total meals served, and then look at the charged tips to figure out how much cash tips you received.”
He suggests that when you pay by credit card, put a 1% tip on it and then pay the rest of the tip in cash, so as to skew the average.

It is difficult for governments to determine how much they lose because of their inability to tax cash transactions.
At one point the U.S. government estimated that only 68% of business income that can be off-the-books ever gets reported to the IRS—and that drops to less than 50% for sole proprietors.
Certain categories of “informal suppliers” who work off-the-books on a cash basis are thought by the agency to declare only 20% of their income (and many of them, I suspect, declare the income in order to qualify for tax credits, rather than to subject themselves to income tax).
