Consumer strikes are more wide-ranging than targeted boycotts of resistance movement foes or of government monopoly products.
Consumer strikers withdraw participation in commerce <em>generally</em> as a way to deprive the government of resources or to put pressure on it.
This can reduce the revenue from a range of taxes—such as income taxes, sales taxes, and value-added taxes.
It can also encourage merchants to pressure the government to make concessions in order to end the strike.

For example, when a boatload of cruise ship passengers arrived in Cairo in 1947, they discovered that they would be subject to an unexpected and hefty “landing tax.”
Instead, they refused to disembark.
The tourist-dependent shopkeepers were so alarmed by this that they rioted and forced the tax officials to waive the tax.

An acute strike like this is more dramatic, but a consumer slow-down may also be effective.
If consumer behavior is taxed (as it often is) frugality and anti-consumerism become tax resistance tactics.
Your campaign may find that by encouraging a do-it-yourself, cooperative, solidarity-economy, recycling ethos, that among the virtues this promotes is the redirection of resources away from the government and into the movement and the community that nurtures it.
