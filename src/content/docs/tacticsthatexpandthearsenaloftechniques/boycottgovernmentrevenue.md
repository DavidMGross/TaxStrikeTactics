You can deprive the government of funds by boycotting goods sold by the government (or by government-protected monopolies that subsidize the government), or goods that are subject to a particular tax.

## Revolts in British Colonies

The monopoly on tea imports that the British government enforced in the American colonies was “equal to a tax” in the eyes of Samuel Adams and his fellow patriots.
Resisters boycotted monopoly tea, and famously backed up this boycott with actions like the Boston Tea Party, in which they destroyed monopoly tea before it reached the marketplace.

Other monopoly British imports that suffered from the American boycott included paper, cloth, dye, house paint, and glass.
One patriotic song celebrated the boycott (while at the same time educating listeners about its extent) in this way:

> The use of the taxables, let us forbear:—<br />
> (Then merchants import till your stores are all full,<br />
> May the buyers be few, and your traffic be dull!)…
>
> …rather than freedom we part with our tea,<br />
> And well as we love the dear draught when a-dry,<br />
> As American Patriots our taste we deny—<br />
> Pennsylvania’s gay meadows can richly afford<br />
> To pamper our fancy or furnish our board;<br />
> And paper sufficient at home still we have,<br />
> To assure the wiseacre, we will not sign slave;<br />
> When this homespun shall fail, to remonstrate our grief,<br />
> We can speak viva voce, or scratch on a leaf;<br />
> Refuse all their colors, though richest of dye,<br />
> When the juice of a berry our paint can supply,<br />
> To humor our fancy—and as for our houses,<br />
> They’ll do without painting as well as our spouses;<br />
> While to keep out the cold of a keen winter morn,<br />
> We can screen the north-west with a well polished horn;

The Indian independence campaign also boycotted British-monopoly goods like salt and cloth.
The campaign not only encouraged people to wear only Indian-produced fabric and clothing, but it also held bonfires and asked people to burn all of the British cloth they owned.

## American War Tax Resisters

During the American war on Vietnam, “[o]ne pacifist, imprisoned for draft refusal and therefore lacking income to refuse taxes on, gave up smoking because the cigarette tax brings the government more revenue than any other single consumer-commodity tax.”

As internet telephony started to become an option, some American war tax resisters realized they could avoid the federal excise tax on telephone service by getting rid of their phone lines and switching to such internet-based plans.

## Quakers

When the Continental Congress imposed a tax on postage stamps to help pay for the American revolutionary war effort, Quaker James Mott decided to stop using the mail. He wrote to a friend shortly before the tax came into effect:

> Must our correspondence by mail be at end, in consequence of the extra postage? or shall we pay it, and thereby contribute a mite to the support of measures calculated to destroy men’s lives and property? Perhaps I may be alone in refusing to pay postage on letters. Only a few cents—what can this do, it may be said, towards enabling government to prosecute the war? Very little, I own: but the great sum required is made up of littles; and if all those littles are withheld, the effusion of human blood may be at an end.

Many years later, Congress issued revenue stamps that it required people to purchase and to apply to certain types of documents. One Quaker wrote in 1900:

> I am one of those (I suppose there are others), who have felt an extreme unwillingness to help maintain our wars by the use of the revenue stamps, which were legalized expressly for war uses. Our forefathers would have made an emphatic protest against it, if indeed they would not have refused entirely to use the stamps, and borne the consequences, whatever they might have been.… at least we could restrict the use of checks (for example) wherever possible, and diminish in this way our contributions to the war fund.

Other Quakers, like Isaac Martin, refused to use or to deal in imported goods, so as to avoid paying import duties that were being directed to military expenses:

> [A] weighty concern attended my mind on account of a tax on shop keepers who dealt in foreign articles, to be appropriated towards carrying on the war against England.… I believed my peace of mind would be affected if I paid the said tax. So I resigned myself to the Lord’s will, let the event be as it may. But scarcely a day passed, that I had not to turn customers away who applied for articles which I had on hand, but could not sell, on account of the heavy penalty.

Many Quaker meetings also had a policy of warning their members against “sharing or partaking in the spoils of war by purchasing or selling prize-goods”—that is, goods seized from the ships of enemy nations by government-sanctioned pirates.

During the Vietnam War the North Columbus, Ohio, Friends Meeting was unable to agree on whether to reluctantly pay the federal excise tax on its office phone (a tax that had been extended to help pay for the war) or whether to illegally resist it.
As a compromise, the meeting decided to discontinue its phone service entirely.

## Anti-Czarist Activism

In Russia around the time of the Vyborg Manifesto, a report noted that “the peasants are deciding to boycott all state-owned businesses.”
For example: “they have undertaken a concerted abstention from vodka, the manufacture and sale of which intoxicant was made a Government monopoly… [which] has since constituted one of the principal sources of the public revenue.”

## Obstructing in Addition to Boycotting

You can augment a boycott by obstructing the sale of boycotted goods:

* In Wales, truckers blockaded a Chevron refinery and called upon the tanker operators to join them in shutting it down, to protest the government’s tax on fuel.
* Farmers in Argentina decided in 2009 to “halt sales of grains and livestock for a week, setting up roadblocks and hampering exports to press for lower taxes.”
* In Greece resisters to taxes that were added to utility bills have barricaded the offices of utility companies.

## Divestment and Boycotts of Nations

In 2003, as the U.S. was launching its attack on Iraq, anti-war activists from other countries began to promote a boycott of the products of U.S. government contractors, and even of U.S. companies in general.
“The U.S. economy is strung out across the globe. Its economic outposts are exposed and vulnerable,” wrote Arundhati Roy.
“Our strategy must be to isolate Empire’s working parts and disable them one by one.
No target is too small.
No victory too insignificant.”

Similarly, the “Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions” movement aims to boycott businesses that profit from Israeli settlement expansion in occupied Palestine.

The model for this approach is the movement that promoted divestment from apartheid South Africa.
That movement, which peaked in the 1980s, successfully pressured businesses, governments, and other institutions around the world to restrict or abandon their economic support for the regime and for those businesses that helped to prop it up.
Universities, targeted by persistent student activists, were among the more prominent institutions to divest from companies doing business in South Africa.
In one fell swoop in 1986, the entire University of California system divested itself of some $3 billion in apartheid-tainted investments.
