Communicating well can be crucial to the success of your campaign.
Evaluate your tactics with an eye not only to their primary effects, but also to the message they send.

It can also help your campaign develop the support and sympathy of non-participants, and even of former antagonists.

This chapter discusses several tactics tax resistance campaigns have used in the service of education and public relations.
