In 2003, when the United States launched its “shock and awe” attack on the people in Iraq, I decided I couldn’t live with myself if I kept paying for the stupid and cruel actions of the U.S. government.
I became a tax resister.
But it was only after I started to resist that I became aware that I was joining a community of tax resisters and a historical lineage of resisters and resistance campaigns.

The more I connected with this community and researched this lineage the more interested I became in the history of tax resistance, its varieties, and the many creative tactics people have developed in the course of tax resistance campaigns.
I kept digging through the archives and kept finding more interesting leads, and at the same time I monitored ongoing tax resistance actions around the world to see how they played out in today’s contexts.
Meanwhile, I was blogging on the subject and using my blog as a way to categorize examples and to cross-reference common threads between them in the hope that some day I might be able to draw some useful conclusions from what I was finding.

I published a tax resistance reader in 2008 that brought together documents from some of the more interesting examples of tax resistance campaigns from around the world and throughout history.
I followed that by publishing a documentary history of war tax resistance among American Quakers up through the end of the 19th century.

I spent two years on the administrative committee of the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee and learned more about the challenges of building a campaign out of a group of diversely-motivated tax resisters.
That group sent me to Colombia last year to an international conference on war tax resistance where I met some of our counterparts in other countries and I gave a presentation on the lessons war tax resisters can learn from historical tax resistance campaigns, which was my first attempt to coalesce the material that evolved into this book.
