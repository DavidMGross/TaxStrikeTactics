Your tax resistance campaign can make history if it learns from the lessons history has to teach.
This book introduces you to tax resistance campaigns from around the world and over thousands of years—including many campaigns that were successful in meeting their goals.
You can be inspired, by reading examples of the tactics they used, to brainstorm new ways to lead your campaign to victory.

If you learn how history’s tax resistance campaigns have played out, you have a great advantage:
you don’t have to reinvent the wheel and you aren’t forced to stick with worn out tactics just because they’re what you’re used to.

## History is a Valuable Resource: Don’t Neglect It

A tax resistance campaign will be more successful if it takes advantage of the rich resource history provides.
Sadly, though, some tax resisters I meet today have little interest in the lessons of the past—they seem to feel as though all they have to do is to take a noble, confrontational stand and then the government must inevitably give in.

Why might this be?
It might be because of how popular media represent successful activist movements of the past—for example, the [civil rights movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement) in the United States.

The most photogenic parts of such movements, and therefore those parts that are most often seen in documentary footage, were big rallies and marches like the [March on Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington), public civil disobedience actions like the [lunch counter sit-ins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-in_movement), and [confrontations with baton-wielding cops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_to_Montgomery_marches).
Today’s activists sometimes act as though they think that if those photogenic elements can be resummoned somehow, success can’t be far behind—in much the same way that “cargo cult” practitioners hope to resummon the bountiful airplanes to their island by building an ersatz air control tower out of bamboo.

You might as well expect to gain independence for California by throwing crates of tea into San Francisco Bay.
Superficial fetishization of the theatrical residue of history gets you a renaissance faire, not a successful activist movement.

## A Successful Tax Resistance Campaign is More than a Tax Resistance Campaign

The successful tax resistance campaigns I studied engaged in struggles on many fronts, using a variety of tactics, and with a great deal of hard work and organizing behind the scenes.
The dramatic sit-ins and salt-marches and so forth are just the fruit of well-tended trees, where much of the hard work is happening at the roots.

Your tax resistance campaign is less likely to succeed if it limits itself to tax resistance.
To be most successful, your campaign must deploy an appropriate and effective set of tactics on a number of additional fronts that, in combination, increase its effectiveness.

This book helps you choose the best tactics for your campaign by showing you how historical tax resistance campaigns have waged their struggles on these fronts.
It also inspires you by showing you many examples of the creativity and determination with which people throughout history have fought back against the tax collector.
