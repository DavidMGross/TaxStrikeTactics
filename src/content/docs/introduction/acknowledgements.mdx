I would not have been able to conduct the research I needed for this book were it not for the tools now available on the Internet.
Each of these tools represents the hard work and generosity (or occasionally the hopeful business model) of helpful people.
I want to thank in particular Google for its searchable news and books archives, for its automated translation service, and of course for its search engine.
Thanks also to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) for making it easier to follow leads, to [PBworks](https://www.pbworks.com/) for the wiki tool I originally used to organize my notes, and to specialty media archives like [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), [Making of America](https://collections.library.cornell.edu/moa_new/index.html), [Old Fulton New York](https://fultonhistory.com/Fulton.html), [PapersPast](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/), [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/), [<i>Friends Journal</i>](https://www.friendsjournal.org/issue-archive/), [Missouri Digital Heritage](https://www.sos.mo.gov/mdh/), and [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/) for enabling me to search through the first draft of history.

I did not consciously pattern this book on the nonviolent action scholarship of [Gene Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Sharp), but I was certainly influenced by having read his books, particularly his volume on [<i>The Methods of Nonviolent Action</i> (1973)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Politics_of_Nonviolent_Action) which describes a variety of resistance tactics in a way that is similar to how I have done so here.

I am grateful to Jason Rawn and to Claire Wolfe for looking over my drafts and giving me the benefit of their helpful criticism.

Thanks also to the [National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee](https://nwtrcc.org/) (U.S.) for sending me to the 14th International Conference on War Tax Resistance and Peace Tax Campaigns in Bogotá, Colombia, where I delivered the talk that developed into this book.
I am grateful also to the conference hosts, [<span lang="es">Acción Colectiva de Objetores y Objetoras de Conciencia</span>](https://acooc.org/inicio/).

Open source coders who contributed to the [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) projects (and the various libraries and tools they rely on) enabled me to turn this book into a website gracefully.

I should note that this is not meant to be a book of rigorous history.
Some of the incidents I use as examples in this book are based on single accounts, written by possibly biased or careless reporters.
In many cases it has not been possible to verify the stories with additional research, and in other cases I have been content not to look much further.
Inevitably some exaggerations and possibly outright fictions have found their way into this book.

I was able to find a great many more sources in American and Australian news archives than in those of other countries, partially because the state of the Internet when I was researching made such sources more available and easily searchable, but also because English is the only language in which I’m fluent.
The next person to follow the trail I’ve been on will surely find many interesting byways I missed.

As I was doing the research for this book, I was also blogging about what I was finding.
My blog [“The Picket Line”](https://sniggle.net/TPL) has a good [subject-matter index](https://sniggle.net/TPL/index5.php?entry=outline5), so if you find some lead in this book that you would like to follow further, that would be a good place to start.
