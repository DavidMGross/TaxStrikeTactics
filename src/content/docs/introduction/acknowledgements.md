I would not have been able to conduct the research I needed for this book were it not for the tools now available on the Internet.
Each of these tools represents the hard work and generosity (or occasionally the hopeful business model) of helpful people.
I want to thank in particular Google for its searchable news and books archives, for its automated translation service which has made it easier for me to search for and understand texts in languages I cannot otherwise parse, and of course for its search engine.
Thanks also to Wikipedia for making it easier to follow leads, to PBworks for the wiki tool I used to organize my notes, and to specialty news media archives like Making of America, Old Fulton New York, PapersPast, Chronicling America, <i>Friends Journal</i>, Missouri Digital Heritage, and Trove for enabling me to search through the first draft of history.

I did not consciously pattern this book on the nonviolent action scholarship of Gene Sharp, but I was certainly influenced by having read his books, particularly his volume on <i>The Methods of Nonviolent Action</i> (1973) which describes a variety of resistance tactics in a way that is similar to how I have done so here.

I am grateful to Jason Rawn and to Claire Wolfe for looking over my drafts and giving me the benefit of their helpful criticism.

Thanks also to the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee (U.S.) for sending me to the 14th International Conference on War Tax Resistance and Peace Tax Campaigns in Bogotá, Colombia.
I am grateful also to the conference hosts, Acción Colectiva de Objetores y Objetoras de Conciencia.

Perhaps I should note here that this is not meant to be a book of rigorous history.
Some of the incidents I use as examples in this book are based on single accounts, written by possibly biased or careless reporters.
In many cases it has not been possible to verify the stories with additional research, and in others I have been content not to look much further.
Inevitably some exaggerations and possibly outright fictions have found their way into this book.

I was able to find a great many more sources in American and Australian news archives than in those of other countries, partially because the current state of the Internet makes such sources more available and easily searchable, but also because English is the only language in which I’m fluent.
The next person to follow the trail I’ve been on will surely find many interesting byways I missed.

As I was doing the research for this book, I was also blogging about what I was finding.
My blog [“The Picket Line”](http://sniggle.net/TPL) has a good [subject-matter index](https://sniggle.net/TPL/index5.php?entry=outline5), so if you find some lead in this book that you would like to follow further, that would be a good place to start.
