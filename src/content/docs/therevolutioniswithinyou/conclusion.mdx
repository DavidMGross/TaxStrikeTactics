I tried to put forward the strongest case for the practical effectiveness of the personal revolution, at least as it can be found in Hennacy’s and Thoreau’s writings.

They make a persuasive argument, I think, but not an airtight one.
I wish more evidence was preserved of them in dialog with incisive critics of the personal revolution, to hear how they would respond to the best arguments against it.

But what keeps the argument for a personal revolution from persuading people is not, I think, the strength of the counter-arguments, but the fact that to accept the argument is not enough—it demands much more than clicking “Like,” and more than most people think they have to give.
To be persuaded is to be overwhelmed, to take the first step off the path and into uncharted territory, and it takes courage to take that step and to keep walking.
