Mutual Insurance Pacts","Your campaign can reassure resisters by insuring them against government reprisals.",[],"doc",{"order":54,"hidden":39,"attrs":55},2,{},"import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';\n\nPeople are more willing to risk the wrath of the government in a tax resistance campaign if they know the weight of that wrath will not fall wholly on them.\nOne way your campaign can provide this reassurance is by forming a mutual insurance plan, so that if the government retaliates against a resister that person won’t have to bear the consequences alone.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Dublin Water Charge Strike\n\nThe 1994–96 water charge strike in Dublin was a mass refusal to pay new government fees, ostensibly for water and other utilities, that the resisters felt were a regressive “double tax” on households.\nThe government tried to defeat the campaign by harshly targeting a few individual resisters in the hopes that this would discourage the rest.\nOne strike leader noted:\n\n> The campaign immediately took a decision that when any individual was summonsed to court, we would turn up and contest every case—and that we would turn up in force.…\n> [W]e made a decision which would prove crucial to the success of the campaign.\n> We decided to initiate a membership of the campaign at £2 per household.\n> This money would go into a war-chest to pay legal fees so that no individual would be left facing a legal bill.\n> The idea that the individuals being taken to court were representing all of us was paramount.\n> Within weeks 2,500 households had paid the £2 membership fee, and within 12 months there were over 10,000 paid-up households…\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> American War Tax Resisters\n\nAmerican war tax resisters organize what they call “penalty funds.”\nWith these, a community of resisters and sympathizers come together to pay any penalties & interest that the government manages to seize from a resister.\n\nFor example, the [“War Tax Resisters Penalty Fund”](https://nwtrcc.org/wtrpf/) works this way:\nIf the IRS successfully seizes resisted taxes from a war tax resister, the resister notifies the Fund about the seizure and sends documentation that shows what portion of what was seized can be attributed to penalties & interest (the portion that was not simply the taxes that the resister had originally refused to pay).\nThe Fund then divides this amount by the number of supporters who have subscribed to the Fund, and sends these supporters a request for that amount.\nThe supporters send in their checks, and the Fund combines these to send a reimbursement to the resister.\n\nThis means that the resister doesn’t lose any more money because of the seizure than they would have lost if they had just paid their taxes in the first place.\n\nThis helps give courage to American war tax resisters who might otherwise be intimidated by the financial impact of penalties & interest.\nIt also helps a wider community to participate in the resistance of an individual resister.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Chicago Property Tax Strike\n\nYou can use this sort of mutual aid to play offense as well as defense.\nYour campaign can pool money to file lawsuits or injunctions that challenge government enforcement methods or the tax itself.\n\nThe Association of Real Estate Taxpayers (ARET) led a mass property tax strike in Depression-era Chicago.\nThey had 30,000 members who each paid annual dues of $15.\nThis money funded lawsuits that challenged a corrupt tax assessment system that illegally undervalued (or failed to list) the property of some wealthy and politically-influential landowners.\n\n> By signing up, taxpayers of modest means could secure professional legal service for a grand total of fifteen dollars in fees.\n> The attorney general of Illinois estimated that ARET’s nine suits, if paid for by one person, would cost a total of $200,000!\n> By offering this legal service, ARET put within reach of the ordinary taxpayer an avenue of protest otherwise prohibitive to all but the wealthiest.\n\nA judge agreed with their arguments and invalidated the tax rolls for 1928–30, which made the city unable to collect unpaid property taxes for those years.\n“As the matter stands,” one newspaper account put it, “citizens howled about their taxes, refused to pay them and a court upheld them.\nThey are in revolt with legal sanction.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Anti Dray and Land Tax League\n\nCampaigns that organize mutual insurance plans may have to make tough decisions about how the plans are funded and used—for instance, whether the insurance will benefit all resisters, or only those resisters who are also contributors to the mutual insurance fund.\n\nThe Anti Dray and Land Tax League organized a successful tax resistance campaign in South Australia in 1850.\nThey formed a mutual insurance pact during the enthusiasm of the early days of the movement, without putting much thought into the details of how the fund would work.\nThis led to internal disputes.\n\nSome thought the fund should be used to legally challenge every action the government took against every resister (an advocate for this position noted that “the moral force of the League was greatly enhanced by every triumph” in the lower courts).\nOthers thought the fund should instead be used to vigorously appeal one particular test case to the Supreme Court in the hopes of having the tax declared to be invalid.\n\nSome felt that only those who had contributed to the fund should be protected by it, and they put forward a motion:\n“That no expense be incurred on behalf of any person whose hundred [division] has not contributed £20 to the funds of the League.”\nBut other campaign members opposed the idea that the League’s legal help would be restricted to dues-paying members.\nThey believed that this would discourage the poorer members from resisting, and that because these dues would themselves resemble a tax, it “would savour strongly of the principle they were associated to oppose” and “would be a worse tyranny” than the tax they had associated to fight.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The Breton Association\n\nThe Breton Association organized tax resistance in the waning days of Charles X’s reign in France in 1829.\nThey were more deliberate and precise when they established their mutual insurance fund, as you can see from their pledge:\n\n> 1. To subscribe individually for ten francs… [and] to pay the same money on presentation of the drafts of Procurators-general, in case they should be named conformably to the third article of the present declaration.\n> 1. This subscription will form a common stock or fund for all Brittany, destined to indemnify the subscribers for any expense they may be put to by their refusal to pay any illegal contributions imposed upon the public…\n> 1. In case of any illegal change in the mode of elections, or any illegal establishment of the taxes, two proxies of each district will assemble at Pontivy, and as soon as they are twenty in number, they will have power to elect amongst the subscribers three procurators-general and an under-procurator in each of the five departments.\n> 1. The duty of the general procurators will be to receive the subscriptions, to afford indemnities conformably to the second article, at the request of any subscriber prosecuted for the payment of illegal contributions; to sue in his name through the sub-procurator of his department for justice against the exactors by all possible means allowed by law; and to become the accusers of all those who are accomplices or abettors of the establishment of illegal taxes.\n> 1. The subscribers named and proxies of this district [are] to assemble with the proxies of the other districts, and to deposit the present subscription in the hands of the general procurators.\n\nSuch precision made it clear to subscribers what they were subscribing to and how decisions would be made about the use of the fund.\nThis made it less likely that the Association’s work would be distracted by arguments like those that came up in the Anti Dray and Land Tax League.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Kerr, Gregor [“Lessons from beating the water charges”](http://www.wsm.ie/c/lessons-beating-water-charges—1990s)\n* I am a subscriber to the war tax resisters penalty fund, and I made an application for reimbursement of $813 in penalties and interest in 2009.

Charge Strike\n\nDuring the Dublin water charge strike in 1994–96, the courts were another way resisters could disrupt the government in the hopes of forcing it to concede:\n\n> Every possible legal angle was pursued by the campaign’s legal team—down to legal definitions of what constituted a householder, making the councils prove that the person they had summonsed actually lived at the address, that they owned the property, etc., etc.\n> We weren’t doing this because we had any illusions in the impartiality of the court system.\n> We knew that even though we were successful in finding various legal loopholes, these would all be closed one by one and that the judges would be doing their best to facilitate the councils…\n>\n> But by contesting every detail of every summons we could make the system unworkable.\n> There were tens of thousands of non-payers.\n> After several months the councils had only managed to get a couple of dozen cases through the courts.\n> Someone calculated that at the rate they were managing to proceed it would take them something like 220 years to process all the cases.\n> And it was costing them more in legal fees than they could ever hope to take back in charges—even if they managed to bully everyone into paying.\n>\n> Any time the council did manage to get a court order, it was appealed—again the objective being to clog up the system.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nThe water charge resisters learned well from the successes of the poll tax resistance movement in Britain a few years before.\nDanny Burns, in his chronicle of that struggle, described the careful and methodical way the anti-poll tax campaign defended resisters in court.\n\nThey kept track of and reached out to people facing legal sanctions for their resistance:\n\n> In Bristol when the court cases started, each person with a summons who rang into the office was logged and sent an information pack.\n> The same personal attention was given to people with notices from the bailiffs.\n> At the peak of the campaign, the Bristol office was staffed morning and afternoon five days a week by different volunteers.\n> Between February and May 1990, it was receiving over 200 calls a week.…\n> [Volunteers included] at least five court support workers…\n\nThey trained volunteers in strategies to make the legal proceedings work for the benefit of the resisters:\n\n> In every part of England and Wales local groups mobilised to provide support for non-payers in the courts.\n> Tens if not hundreds of activists in each region attended legal briefing sessions.\n> These were run both by activists and sympathetic local lawyers.\n> People were given ideas about how they might disrupt or delay the court proceedings.\n> These included simple things, like asking for a glass of water because their throat was dry, demanding to see the identity cards of everyone present in court, to fainting in court or arranging for fire alarms to go off.\n> People were told to demand their rights to see and read every document which was produced as evidence against them.\n> They were also given briefings on the basic technical arguments.\n>\n> By October 1990, when most of the court cases had started, virtually every Anti-Poll Tax Union in the UK had trained at least two or three of its members to become conversant with the Poll Tax law.\n> Throughout England and Wales over a thousand people were trained to do court support work and could quote the relevant legislation….\n\nWith expert oversight, they published a legal guide for resisters:\n\n> [T]he Poll Tax Legal Group… researched legislation and case law.\n> It set up a network of lawyers throughout England and Wales who could support the legal challenges of Anti-Poll Tax groups and produced over 30 accessible legal bulletins on the Poll Tax and a book called \u003Ci>To Pay or Not To Pay\u003C/i>.\n> These underpinned the legal needs of the movement and helped ordinary people to get to grips with the law they needed to use.\n\nAnd they successfully fought back by exploiting legal technicalities:\n\n> Councils were challenged for sending notices to the wrong addresses.\n> Given the rate at which people moved houses, it was difficult for the councils to keep up, and as a result many cases were dropped because people hadn’t received proper notice.\n> Big legal challenges were also made over “correct procedures.”\n> These came in the first few weeks and resulted mostly from the inexperience of councils in dealing with this sort of process.\n> The first day of Medina Council’s cases (on the Isle of Wight) is probably the most famous example.\n> The reminder notices were sent out with second class stamps, they consequently arrived late, people didn’t receive the statutory notice which they were entitled to, and the court threw out all 1,900 cases.\n> The council had to start again.\n\nWhen police attacked an anti-poll tax demonstration in London, many demonstrators fought back, and hundreds were arrested.\nSome elements of the campaign leadership distanced themselves from the defendants, worried about the public relations problems of associating the movement with violence.\nSo other activists helped to form and coordinate an independent group—the Trafalgar Square Defendants’ Campaign (TSDC)—with the following mandate:\n\n> The campaign will:\n> * Unconditionally defend all of those arrested on March 31st.\n> * Be controlled by and be accountable to the defendants\n> * Be totally independent of any other organisation.\n> * Seek support from the whole Anti-Poll Tax movement and all other sympathetic organisations.\n> * Seek to co-ordinate the legal defence of all those arrested.\n> * Seek to build a coherent picture of events of 31/3/90 from the point of view of those arrested.\n> * Publicise the points of view of defendants.\n> * Raise money for a bust fund, controlled by the defendants to cover their legal and welfare costs.\n> * Ensure that at all future Anti-Poll Tax events there will be proper legal cover and support for anyone arrested.\n>   This will include an office and workers to visit places of detention and look after prisoners’ welfare.\n\nBurns writes, of the TSDC:\n\n> About a dozen people volunteered to carry out the court monitoring process.\n> They attended every hearing, systematically took notes of everything that was said, recorded the numbers of police officers and approached the defendants asking them to attend the now weekly TSDC meetings…\n> By the summer, over 250 of the defendants had been contacted.\n>\n> The TSDC ran advice sessions on prison, produced legal briefing notes and mailed out the minutes of the weekly meetings to every defendant every week.\n> A solicitors’ group was established with a core of three, but at the peak of early activity they managed to get over fifteen solicitors involved.\n> This proved important because the solicitors’ group managed to get hold of over 50 hours of police videos and handed them over to the campaign.\n> The police videos were crucial in getting a lot of people off, and a number of people in the campaign worked extremely hard editing videos and rejigging them for particular trials.\n> The solicitors’ group also got the Crown Prosecution Service to hand over a full list of all of the defendants and the names and addresses of their lawyers.\n> The lawyers were all contacted and, although many were initially reluctant to cooperate with the campaign, they soon realised that TSDC had a lot of information which their clients needed.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nLegal expertise can also help your campaign find flaws in the tax law that can expose it to ridicule.\nFor instance, in 1912 Mark Wilks was arrested and sent to Brixton Prison for failing to pay \u003Cem>his wife’s\u003C/em> income taxes.\nThe case became a \u003Ci>cause célèbre\u003C/i> in the British women’s suffrage movement and an embarrassment to the British government.\n\nEthel Ayres Purdie, a tax law expert with the Women’s Tax Resistance League, discovered the vulnerability.\nThe Income Tax Act, she wrote, “is a most fearsome piece of composition.\nIts language is archaic and tautological, it rises wholly superior to punctuation, and proceeds breathlessly through one hundred and ninety-four clauses.”\nOne of those clauses held a flaw.\n\n![Are you sure you are not paying too much tax to John Bull? We have recovered or saved large sums for women taxpayers. Why not consult us? It will cost you nothing.](../../../assets/women-taxpayers-agency.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>an ad for Ethel Ayres Purdie’s “Women Taxpayers’ Agency”\u003C/figcaption>\n\nThe Married Woman’s Property Act of 1882 allowed married women to maintain control of their property rather than relinquishing it to their husbands’ control upon marriage.\nBut the earlier (1842) Income Tax Act still considered the husband to be solely liable for the income taxes of both the husband and wife.\n\nAt first, when Elizabeth Wilks began resisting her income tax, the government responded by seizing and selling her property, but when this quirk in the law was discovered, tax resisters like Wilks protested that the government could not legally seize \u003Cem>her\u003C/em> property since as a married woman her taxes were legally owed by the \u003Cem>him\u003C/em> in the marriage.\nSo the government went after Mark Wilks instead and arrested him when he did not pay his wife’s taxes.\n\nMark Wilks insisted that he could hardly fill out an income tax return since he had no legal right to demand information from his wife about her income!\nBesides, his own modest income and lack of property in his own name meant that he could not afford to pay the taxes on his wife’s considerably larger income (he did pay the tax on the portion of their joint income that was attributable to his own income, though his income was low enough that by itself it would not have been taxable).\n“I am informed that I am liable for taxes levied on her income,” he complained, “while at the same time the law places all her property entirely beyond my control.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Women’s Tax Resistance League trumpeted the arrest of Mark Wilks and his indefinite imprisonment—“for non-payment of taxes not his own and due on an income over which he has no control and whose amount he can only guess at”—as proving their contention that not only should women resist the income tax, but that married women were not even legally obligated to pay it and those women who were paying it were operating under a legal delusion.\n\nThe imprisonment of Mark Wilks was a great public relations opportunity:\n\n> For what do the arrest and imprisonment of Mark Wilks mean?\n> We are perfectly certain that it will not last long.\n> Stupid and inept as it has been, the Government, we are certain, will not risk the odium which would justly fall upon it if this outrage on liberty went on.\n> A Government which has much at stake and which lives by the breath of popular opinion cannot afford to ignore such strong and healthy protest as is being poured out on all sides.\n> To us, who are in the midst of it, that which seems most remarkable is the growth of public feeling.\n> In the streets where processions are nightly held, we were met at first by banter and rowdyism.\n> “A man in prison for the sake of Suffragettes!”\n> To the boy-mind of the metropolis, on the outskirts of many an earnest crowd, that seemed irresistibly funny; but thoughtfulness is spreading; into even the boy-mind, the light of truth is creeping.\n> If it had done nothing else, the imprisonment of Mark Wilks has certainly done this—it has educated the public mind.\n\nWilks was released after less than a month in prison, without receiving any official explanation, and without paying the tax.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Maurice McCrackin\n\nNot all legal help is welcome.\nSome resisters prefer to submit passively and unconcernedly to the legal machinations the government puts so much stock in.\nSome such resisters have better things to do than to worry about the minutiae of laws and legal procedures.\nOthers may not want to humor the conceit that a process of justice is taking place around them.\n\nFor example, when American war tax resister Maurice McCrackin was convicted of refusing to cooperate with an IRS summons, he was following a strategy of complete noncooperation.\nHe kept following it right into the courtroom—where he refused to stand for the judge, refused to plead to the charges, refused to answer questions, refused to consult with his court-appointed attorney, fasted while behind bars, and had to be wheeled into and out from his court appearances because he wouldn’t walk there under his own power.\n\nFor the same reason, upon his conviction, he emphatically said that he was not interested in pursuing an appeal:\n“I said I wanted to file no appeal, nor did I want steps taken to keep the door open, so an appeal could be perfected later.\nI do not recognize any appeal on my behalf…\nMy position is not changed.\nThis is a moral, not a legal, struggle.”\nOne of the lawyers who had been assigned to defend him, however, was convinced that the judge had betrayed bias against McCrackin in his statements from the bench, and said that he intended to disregard his client’s wishes and to appeal anyway.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Beit Sahour\n\nDuring the Beit Sahour tax strike against the Israeli military occupation, Elias Rishmawi worked to get a lawsuit challenging the legality of the tax accepted by Israel’s court system.\nHe recalled:\n\n> I had never had an illusion that the Israeli supreme court would give any justice to Palestinians.…\n> [But] the appeal formed the legal coverage by which I and others were able to continue resisting from one side not paying taxes, since there is a case in court and they cannot force me pay until the case is solved they cannot take any actions against us since we have this case, and we kept challenging the system through different means.…\n> This was impossible to achieve without the legal coverage of the supreme court.\n> Because then, I and the others, would have been considered as inciters and then might be imprisoned for ten years.\n> That’s why we needed that coverage.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Halifax “Vicars’ Rate” Resistance\n\nThe movement that grew to resist the “vicars’ rate” in Halifax, England, in 1875–76, exploited a flaw in the carelessly-written law that implemented the rate.\n\nUnder the law’s provisions, the head of the establishment church in Halifax was to periodically summon five churchwardens and tell them to pay him the tax.\nThe chosen five were obligated to pay as asked.\nThey then were to convene a meeting to decide how to recoup this money from the rest of Halifax.\nResisters took advantage of this by attending this meeting and using parliamentary procedure to immediately adjourn it, thus preventing the poor five suckers from recouping their payments.\nThis tactic was only questionably legal, but it nonetheless was effective in continually delaying payment, as it would have been legally cumbersome to compel a meeting to levy the tax against its will.\n\nA witness to a House of Commons committee testified:\n“In nearly every township a meeting of inhabitants has been held; and at every one of these meetings the motion for adjournment has been carried, which means a refusal to lay the rate.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Kerr, Gregor [“Lessons from beating the water charges”](http://www.wsm.ie/c/lessons-beating-water-charges%E2%80%941990s)\n* Burns, Danny \u003Ci>Poll Tax Rebellion\u003C/i> AK Press (1992), pp. 71–72, 106&ndash;07, 110, 135&ndash;36, 143\n* Purdie, Ethel Ayres “How the Government Defies the Law” \u003Ci>The Vote\u003C/i> 21 September 1912, p. 974\n* Wilks, Mark “Tax Resistance” \u003Ci>The Vote\u003C/i> 24 September 1910, p. 261\n* Boyle, C.

company manufactured\u003C/figcaption>\n\nAmerican industrialist Vivien Kellems so enjoyed tax resistance that it was sometimes hard to tell whether she was resisting from principle or for sport.\nIn 1948 she decided she would not withhold taxes on her employees’ behalf.\nShe explained why:\n\n> Paying taxes is a duty, a responsibility, and a privilege of citizenship.\n> Without taxes we can have no government.\n> However I do not exercise other duties, responsibilities, and privileges of citizenship for my employees.\n> I do not vote for them, I do not form political opinions for them, I do not select a church for them, I do not pay real estate taxes for them.\n> They are all free American citizens, thoroughly capable of performing all of the duties and responsibilities of citizenship for themselves.\n> And so, from this day, I am not collecting nor paying their income taxes for them.\n\nTo demonstrate that she wasn’t against her employees paying their taxes, but only opposed to having to do it for them, she organized her employees once per quarter and allowed them, on company time, to fill out their own tax returns and to go down to the post office as a group to purchase money orders and file their own taxes.\n\nThe U.S. government was not impressed with this gesture.\nIt subjected Kellems to a public smear campaign (they even intercepted her love letters and released them to the press), and to legal action.\nThe government won in court and fined Kellems $7,600, whereupon she resumed withholding taxes from her employees’ paychecks.\n\n## \u003CBadge

government-run health and unemployment benefits.\nMembers of the women’s suffrage movement saw this as yet another tax enacted without their consent—another example of “taxation without representation” and another opportunity to resist.\n\nSome suffrage activists could resist as employers, and some suffrage groups could help their own employees to resist.\nKate Harvey, for example, refused to pay the tax on her gardener’s wages, and was sentenced to two months in prison for her refusal.\nThe Women’s Freedom League refused to pay the tax for its employees, saying “we refuse to acquiesce in any legislation which controls the resources of women without the consent of women.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Quakers\n\nThe Philadelphia Yearly Meeting (of Quakers) believes it has “a religious duty to refrain from taking action that violates an employee’s expression of conscience.”\nSo if an employee requests it, the Meeting will hold “the military

that the taxes will not be used for military purposes.”\n\n\u003CAside type=\"tip\" title=\"See also\">\n[Put Your Taxes in an Escrow Account in lieu of

for the War Resisters League, asked them to stop withholding federal taxes from his paycheck.\nThe League agreed, and some of its other employees followed DiGia’s lead.\n\nIt took a lot of work to get the League to adopt a policy of tax refusal.\nAt first, they had refused.\nA member of the League’s executive committee, afraid of government retribution, said “the life of the organization is at stake.”\nWar tax resisters responded:\n“If pacifist organizations, whose business is to create a warless world, are not ready to risk something for war resistance now, when will they be ready?”\n\nAnother group, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, decided it was not willing to challenge the IRS in this way, and some of its employees resigned as a result.\n\nFor five years, War Resisters International refused to turn over to the government a portion of the taxes withheld from its resisting employees’ wages.\nBut in 2013, when the group heard that the government was preparing to seize its office equipment over the tax debt, it gave up the fight—though not without trying to turn its surrender into an opportunity to stage a protest.\n\n\u003CAside type=\"tip\" title=\"See

in 1983, when pastor Gregory Dixon “decided the church would break all ties with the government and no longer act as its agent in withholding taxes from its employees,” citing Constitutional freedom of religion as his mandate for taking his church out from under Uncle Sam’s thumb.\n\nFor several years, nothing came of this defiance, but in the early 1990s, the IRS started seeking back taxes, and eventually filed liens against the church and against Dixon.\nThe church fought back in court, but lost a series of appeals, and was finally rebuffed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2001, whereupon the

resist as an ongoing commitment rather than a protest or rebellion against a particular government or policy.\n\nGovernments usually inflict taxes when money changes hands:\nIncome taxes when people earn or receive money, payroll taxes when employers pay employees, sales taxes when consumers purchase goods, value-added taxes as goods move through the supply chain, estate taxes when assets are inherited, tariffs and customs duties when transactions take place that cross borders, and so on.\nIndividuals pay some of these taxes directly, and others indirectly through higher prices of goods and services.\n\nSome tax resisters have decided that they can resist such taxes more comprehensively by taking more of their activities out of the marketplace entirely—by relying less on economic transactions and more on community.\nCooperative housing arrangements are one way they can help each other to do this.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Bijou Community\n\nFor instance the Bijou Community in Colorado Springs, Colorado, “runs services for the mentally-ill, homeless, working poor, incarcerated, and the general community, including: a soup kitchen, food banks, a land trust, several homes for transitional and homeless folks, a free bicycle clinic, and a musical theater group” but it also serves as a mutual support for its members, who each earn incomes that are below the taxable level as a method of war tax resistance.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Agape Community\n\nThe [Agape Community](https://agapecommunity.org/) in Massachusetts describes itself as “a lay Catholic residential community, ecumenical and interfaith in outreach and practice, with a focus on daily prayer, evangelical simplicity (eco-spirituality, sustainability, organic garden, vegetable oil fueled car, straw bale house, compost toilet, solar energy, wood stoves for cooking and heat), and nonviolent witness in the world, including actions against war, peace vigils, tax resistance, and civil disobedience when called, as we attempt to build a nonviolent world.”\nIt was founded by war tax resisters and supports volunteers who are living

century, aimed at English landlords and the political structure that prioritized their rights over those of Irish tenants.\nWhen landlords evicted tenants who refused to pay rent, the League would try to find the tenants (and sometimes their livestock) a temporary home on the land of someone who was sympathetic with the resisters.\nThese encampments might grow to hold several families and were sometimes called “Land League Villages.”\nOn one occasion, hundreds of evicted rent strikers founded a new town, “New Tipperary,” on the outskirts of Tipperary, which was largely owned by one rich

The Tar and Feathers Treatment\n\nThe textbook example of humiliation attacks on tax collectors is “tarring and feathering.”\nIt was practiced, in particular, by American revolutionaries.\nAfter the revolution, the Whiskey Rebels also took up the practice.\nIn one case:\n\n![An illustration shows colonial Americans pouring tea into the mouth of a man covered in feathers. In the background a paper labeled &ldquo;Stamp Act&rdquo; is pinned to the Liberty Tree, from which a noose hangs, and people are pouring tea from boxes on a ship into the water](../../../assets/tar-and-feathers.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>“The Bostonians Paying the Excise-man, or Tarring and Feathering”\u003C/figcaption>\n\n> A party of men, armed and disguised, waylaid [Robert Johnson, collector of the revenues] at a place on Pidgeon Creek, in Washington County, seized, tarred and feathered him, cut off his hair, and deprived him of his horse, obliging him to travel on foot a considerable distance in that mortifying and painful situation.\n\nOn other occasions, the rebels “docked [collectors’] horses’ tails, and in at least one instance tarred a collector and rolled him in leaves.”\nOne process server “was seized, whipped, tarred and feathered, and after having his money and horse taken from him, was blindfolded and tied in the woods, in which condition he remained five hours.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Carding\n\nThe Tithe War in Ireland featured violent humiliation attacks known as “carding.”\nAccording to one account:\n\n> The tithe proctor was generally waked out of his first sleep by his door being smashed in; and the \u003Cem>boys\u003C/em> in white shirts desired him “never to fear,” as they only intended to \u003Cem>card\u003C/em> him this bout for taking a quarter instead of a tenth from every poor man in the parish.\n> They then turned him on his face upon the bed; and taking a lively ram cat out of a bag which they brought with them, they set the cat between the proctor’s shoulders.\n> The beast, being nearly as much terrified as the proctor, would endeavour to get off; but being held fast by the tail, he intrenched every claw deep in the proctor’s back, in order to keep up a firm resistance to the White Boys.\n> The more the tail was pulled back, the more the ram cat tried to go forward; at length, when he had, as he conceived, made his possession quite secure, main force convinced him to the contrary, and that if he kept his hold, he must lose his tail.\n> So, he was dragged backward to the proctor’s loins, grappling at every pull, and bringing away, here and there, strips of the proctor’s skin, to prove the pertinacity of his defence.\n> When the ram cat had got down to the loins, he was once more placed at the shoulders, and again \u003Cem>carded\u003C/em> the proctor (\u003Ci>toties quoties\u003C/i>) according to his sentence.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> A Tithe Auction in Wales\n\nIn 1891, an auctioneer who was selling off a farmer’s produce to pay his refused tithes was met with a crowd who were determined that he have a bad day:\n\n> They were armed with eggs of a veteran vintage, and with these they began bombarding the auctioneer and chief constable.\n> Those parties were soon plastered with the odorous stuff, but tried to drive away the crowd by threats of prosecution.\n> This enraged the people more and they set fire to the furze, and seized the auctioneer and tried to duck him in an adjoining pond.\n> He pleaded and promised to give up tithe sales, if they would let him go, which they did.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> LaSaunders Hudson\n\nIn 1972, when state revenue agents tried to collect $197 in back taxes from LaSaunders Hudson at his business in Memphis, Tennessee, Hudson pulled out a gun and told them “to strip to the buff and march out of his store, much to the astonishment of the passersby in predominantly black Park Street.”\n\n> “A crowd of people had already gathered on the street and they cheered and clapped when we walked out,” [agent John Mabile] said.…\n>\n> Mabile said as the agents were removing their underwear, Hudson advised them that “this is part of the punishment we are going to give the white man for injustices done the black man.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Gabelle Riots\n\nDuring the salt tax (\u003Ci>gabelle\u003C/i>) riots in Bordeaux in 1548, some tax collectors were killed, and to make sure the point was well-understood:\n“Their bodies were dragged through the streets and covered in heaps of salt.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Canadian Irish\n\nIn 1881, a deputy sheriff tried to seize property from Irish settlers in Canada who were refusing to pay a county tax.\nInstead, the settlers “compelled him to eat the writs he had, and then gave him a limited time to get out of the township.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Humiliation in Absentia\n\nSome humiliation attacks might be inflicted on the tax collector in absentia or in effigy.\nDuring the Tithe War in Ireland, resisters\n\n> …audaciously dug a grave within sight of Dinefwr Castle, the family seat, and announced that [Colonel George Rice] Trevor would occupy it by 10 October.\n> Trevor, however, surrounded by soldiers, survived unscathed.\n\nAnd during the Whiskey Rebellion,\n\n> [T]he inspector of the revenue was burnt in effigy in Allegany county, at a place, and on a day, of some public election, with much display, and without interruption, in the presence of magistrates and other public officers.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The Tax Collectors’ Chair\n\nWhen a tax professional took a tour of the Ashton Villa in Galveston, Texas, he learned about an interesting tax avoidance tactic from bygone days:\n\n> When you walk into the house you are greeted by the typical fare—a somewhat nice looking staircase, a chandelier, older looking pictures, etc.\n> What is most interesting is the calling card basket and the chair that sits nearby.\n>\n> …The chair is the only real piece of furniture in the room.\n> The chair is made of a beautiful polished wood.\n> It has a nice dark brown stain.\n> But there are some peculiarities about the chair.\n> The seat of the chair has a sharp raised crevice running through the middle in the most obscene manner and the backrest is bent outward in the most unergonomic way.\n> Further, the chair has only one small armrest.\n> The whole contraption is polished and it slants forward at a steep angle.\n> It is a very odd-looking piece of furniture.\n>\n> I could not resist asking the tour guide why anyone would have such a contraption in his or her home.\n> Could the original inhabitants not afford proper furniture?\n> The tour guide explained that, given the calling card system, the only person who would show up without an appointment would be the tax collector.\n> So the tax collector would be offered a seat in the chair and would be left waiting for several hours.\n> The hope was that the tax collector would simply go away.\n> So the chair was a tax savings measure—a tax savings measure that, according to the tour guide, was widely used in wealthy Southern homes before the turn of the last century.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Non-Violent Humiliation\n\nAs that example shows, humiliation doesn’t have to include violence or the threat of violence to be effective.\nMockery is also a nonviolent but humiliating deterrent.\nTax collectors in Bardoli were stymied by villagers who sounded the alarm whenever they approached, so that when they arrived in town “women stood in front of locked doors laughing at them.”\n\nAnother amusing example comes from the tithe resistance campaign in Coventry in 1892:\n\n> The quarrel was attended by a good many fights and some funny episodes as when a farmer, living in the suburbs, upon whose stock it was proposed to levy, greased all his pigs, so that they slipped through the hands of the bailiffs at every attempt, much to the delight of a crowd that witnessed the spectacle.\n> The bailiffs at length gave up the chase in disgust.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and

Annuity Tax Resistance\n\nDuring the Annuity Tax resistance in Edinburgh in the mid-19th century, a group of resisters liberated one of their number who had been arrested.\nA newspaper report at the time said, “we hear that the constables are on the alert each night to catch the marked men; and that, fearing a visit in the dark, these persons quit their homes and sleep abroad.”\nThe government, which had hoped to ease its troubles by putting the troublemakers behind bars, instead found itself faced with the additional bother of tracking down an escapee and his confederates.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Railroad Bond Shenanigans\n\nResidents of Missouri in the late 19th century used a number of methods to avoid being taxed to pay off railroad bonds that their county governments had issued as part of a swindle (the railroad was never built).\nOne method was to elect local judges who were willing to refuse to enforce higher court rulings meant to compel the county to raise the tax funds.\nThose judges risked being jailed on contempt of court charges for such refusal, and so they took office with the understanding that they would spend their term either in jail or in hiding.\nCounty courts would sometimes convene in the woods at night, or in caves, or alongside fake courts with decoy judges, so as to evade federal marshals who were trying to put the resisting judges under arrest.\nAccording to one account:\n\n> Since local taxpayers believed that the judges were, finally, obeying public opinion, they helped the judges evade the marshals and the law.\n> Homeowners welcomed and hid any judge trying to escape the marshals.\n> In Dallas County the court met in the woods, under culverts, in barns, and other places where marshals were not likely to look.\n> At the county seat of Buffalo, residents developed an elaborate network to warn the judges whenever a stranger appeared who might be a marshal.\n\n\u003Chr

however, we saved you from the king’s tariffs, [signed] Robin Hood and his Merry Men.\n> Please consider paying it forward,” and include an address where donations can be sent.\n\nIn 2013, the city, alleging that the Robin Hooders have “repeatedly and intentionally taunted, interfered with, harassed, and intimidated” the meter officers, filed for a restraining order against the group.\nThe activists insisted that this has nothing to do with any intimidation or harassment on their part, but with the city’s loss of revenue from the thousands of parking tickets the group has prevented.\n\n> In the filing, parking enforcement officer Linda Desruisseaux said, “Besides following me, crowding around me, making video recordings of my activities, and placing coins in expired meters to prevent me from writing tickets, these individuals repeatedly taunt and harass me, asking why I am stealing peoples’ money and telling me to get another job…\n> In particular, Graham Colson likes to taunt me by saying, ‘Linda, guess what you’re not going to do today—write tickets.’…\n> The taunting and harassment tends to get worse when there is a group, as they try to one-up each other at my expense.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Toll-Booths\n\nDuring the sixteen months of the Rebecca Riots in Wales, there were over a hundred attacks on toll-houses and toll-gates.\n“During this period, all the gates and bars in the Whitland, Tivyside, and Brechfa Trusts were destroyed.\nTwo gates only out of the twenty-one survived in the Three Commotts Trust, whilst between seventy and eighty gates out of about one hundred and twenty were destroyed in Carmarthenshire.\nOnly nine were left standing out of twenty-two in Cardiganshire.”\n\nHere is one description of how the destruction was carried out:\n\n> The secret was well kept, no sign of the time and place of the meditated descent was allowed to transpire.\n> All was still and undisturbed in the vicinity of the doomed toll-gate, until a wild concert of horns and guns in the dead of night and the clatter of horses’ hoofs, announced to the startled toll-keeper his “occupation gone.”\n> With soldier-like promptitude and decision, the work was commenced; no idle parleying, no irrelevant desire of plunder or revenge divided their attention or embroiled their proceedings.\n> They came to destroy the turnpike and they did it as fast as saws, and pickaxes, and strong arms could accomplish the task.\n>\n> No elfish troop at their pranks of mischief ever worked so deftly beneath the moonlight; stroke after stroke was plied unceasingly, until in a space which might be reckoned by minutes from the time when the first wild notes of their rebel music had heralded the attack, the stalwart oak posts were sawn asunder at their base, the strong gate was in billets, and the substantial little dwelling, in which not half an hour before the collector and his family were quietly slumbering, had become a shapeless pile of stones or brick-bats at the wayside.\n\n![Men and boys with axes, two in womens’s clothing, one on horseback, attack a wooden gate.](../../../assets/rebecca.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>Rebecca and her daughters\u003C/figcaption>\n\nWhen the Scleddy turnpike-gate was attacked, Rebecca and her daughters “broke the gates, posts, walls, and toll-boards into pieces so small that in the morning there was not a piece of the timber larger than would make matches.”\n\nToll-booth destruction was also part of the riots in Naples in 1647: “the toll-booths throughout the town were demolished; the mob went from one gate to another.\nEverywhere the toll-gatherers had escaped—nobody thought of making any resistance…”\n\nToll-booth attacks were also part of the more recent “won’t pay” movement in Greece.\nResisters there mobbed highway toll plazas, raising the bars and waving cars through.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Miscellany\n\nDanny Burns reports that during the poll tax rebellion in Thatcher’s Britain, “it was widely reported that Anti-Poll Tax activists had managed to put a bug into the computer, which randomly wiped out every sixth record on the register.\nThe virus story was never proven.\nHowever, a month before it was mentioned in the newspapers, its effects were accurately described to two Anti-Poll Tax activists by two computer hackers one of whom had worked for Lothian Regional Council and had been sacked.”\n\nIn Anjou during the French Revolution resisters seized the tax clerks’ horses and sold them at auction.\nIn Limoux they invaded the homes of tax officials and took their registers and office furniture and dumped them in the river.\nIn Touraine no sooner were the new tax rolls published but resisters rose up, forced the officials to surrender them, and tore them to pieces.\nIn Creuse, as the clerk began to read the latest tax roll, “the women spring upon him, seize the tax-roll, and ‘tear it up with countless imprecations.’ ”\n\nWhen the Internal Revenue Service seized tax resister Mary Cain’s newspaper, and put a chain and padlock on the front door of its offices, “Mrs. Cain sawed off the lock and chain and mailed them to the Internal Revenue Department with a defiant note.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* “Parking Meter Revolt: Frustration Over High Costs” CBS Chicago 24 March 2009\n* [“Santa’s helpers disable naughty cameras in Tempe”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T43LtGNFLPw&feature=youtu.be) (video)\n* “Slaying Fuels Debate Over Speed Cameras” Associated Press 27 April 2009\n* Ingersoll, Geoffrey “Maryland Police Are Deploying Cameras To Watch Other Cameras” \u003Ci>Business Insider\u003C/i> 13 September 2012\n* Evans, Henry Tobit \u003Ci>Rebecca Riots!\u003C/i> (2010 ed.) pp. 11 (quoting from “Rebecca and Her Daughters” \u003Ci>The Red Dragon\u003C/i>, Vol. XI, 1887, p. 328;

\u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> American War Tax Resisters\n\nThe American war tax resistance group “Peacemakers” was eventually successful in winning back Ernest and Marion Bromley’s home, which had been seized by the government for back taxes.\nIn a retrospective, they claimed:\n\n> The Peacemakers were resolute that their confrontation with the government would be on their terms.…\n> They put enormous energy into building relationships with IRS officials that would allow for honest dialogue.\n> And always, they challenged and responded to the bureaucracy in a highly personal manner.\n\nDorothy Day wrote of this:\n\n> Chuck Matthei had told me the story of his interviews with the head of the Internal Revenue Service, the almost daily dialogue that went on between them, and the frank and “manly” admission, made finally by the IRS chief, that a mistake had been made, that the Peacemakers had Truth on their side.\n> I felt a great sense of joy and thanksgiving, a sense of hope too, that our officials in Washington D.C. could be approached in this way—with dignity and perseverance, with courtesy, with the recognition that we are all, each one of us, whether government official or radical (one who gets to the roots of things), children of God.\n\nIn 2000, war tax resister Robin Harper met with an IRS tax auditor and one of the agency’s “frivolous tax coordinators.”\nHe described how it went:\n\n> I quickly assured them that an accurate accounting should of course be established, but that in no way could I alter my refusal to deliver my tax dollars into the U.S. military machine.\n> Earlier I had described how my conscientious objection was rooted in our Quaker Peace Testimony and how I had performed two years of civilian alternative service with a self-help housing project during the Korean War.\n>\n> With his defensive posture evaporating, Mr. Means [the IRS’s “frivolous tax coordinator”] told us that his father fought in the Korean War and came home tormented by post traumatic stress disorder.\n> Thereafter he would have nothing more to do with guns, “because he had seen what guns can do.”\n> That gave my supporter, who had lived through World War Two in Germany, an opening.\n> Drawing a parallel with my war tax refusal, she pointed out how German income taxes funded the governmental atrocities of the Third Reich.…\n>\n> Near the end I took the opportunity to unfurl the large chart which chronicles my war tax redirection these past forty-one years and to describe how I was first propelled into war tax protest by U.S. nuclear atmospheric bomb testing in Nevada and the Pacific.\n>\n> After more than three hours (and well past normal lunchtime), the two finally closed the interview with smiles and friendly handshakes.\n> Mr. Means even admitted that his title of “Frivolous Tax Coordinator” was really a substitute for “Tax Protester Coordinator,” an internal administrative category which Congress had abolished in recent Taxpayer Bill of Rights legislation.\n>\n> Despite their training to be suspicious (all taxpayers are trying to get away with something), IRS folk, like all human beings, can be positively affected by openness, honesty, and sincerity.\n> Transparency can often trump suspicion.\n>\n> I have learned how we all hunger for caring, person-to-person exchanges.\n> Look how a one hour audit stretched into more than three hours, much of which involved genuine sharing far beyond the scope of the audit!\n>\n> As our discussion rose above tax details, Mr. Means, the tax protester “sheriff,” was led to cast aside some of his official persona and let his personal feelings and thoughts come through.\n> He also became increasingly interested in discerning what makes war tax refusers tick.\n> I am sure he came to understand that our witness is anything but “frivolous.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Quakers\n\nQuaker Thomas Watson was seized by the American army during the revolution, and condemned “to be stripped and ironed, and on the next afternoon to be publicly hanged” for refusing to use the continental currency that Congress had issued to finance the war.\nHis family was given little hope for him.\n“You may go home,” one petitioner was told, “and rest assured your uncle will be hanged.”\n\n> But the wife of the prisoner had a warm friend in the landlady of the inn at Newtown; and when was woman’s kindness ever invoked for the relief of suffering, or woman’s tact required in vain?\n> She was advised not to apply in person for the release of her husband.\n> The landlady had learned Lord Sterling’s fondness for the creaturely comforts of life; and knew that wine had the effect to soften the severity of his temper.\n> To take advantage of this disposition, she invited him to a sumptuous dinner.\n> He did full justice to the delicacies of the table, and willingly partook of the generous old wine, which had been reserved for special occasions.\n> As the wine warmed the General’s good-nature and disposed him to kindlier feelings, she cautiously introduced the case of the condemned; pitied his condition, cold, and in irons; regarded his treatment as needlessly severe; and at length requested that his fetters might be removed and his clothes restored to him.\n> He could not resist this appeal of his hostess; and a note was sent to the guard in answer to her request.\n>\n> The good woman continued her entreaties, and still plied the wine; when, at the proper moment, the wife was introduced.\n> She fell on her knees before him, burst into a flood of tears, and told him who she was, and, with all the earnestness, feeling, and eloquence of a loving wife pleading for the one she loved best on earth, begged him to spare her husband’s life.\n> Her entreaties were of a nature hard to be withstood.\n> He remained some time silent; then, raising her to her feet, he said, “Madam, you have conquered.\n> I must relent at the tears and supplications of so noble and so good a woman as you.\n> Your husband is saved.”\n> He immediately wrote a pardon for the prisoner, and ordered his discharge.\n> The happy pair now returned to their homes rejoicing.\n\nBut such shows of hospitality do not always end well, as Quaker Henry Paxson learned when he was visited by the tax collector some 300 years ago.\nHe treated the collector to his best food and cider, and the ungrateful collector responded by seizing “the plates he had eaten on, and the tankard he so freely toped out of.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca Rioters could be cruel, even deadly, to the keepers of the toll gates they were destroying.\nBut more frequently, they would allow the keepers a few moments to collect their personal belongings and remove them from the building before they demolished it.\nOn some occasions, the encounters were almost cordial:\n\n> The gate-keeper begged of them not to destroy the furniture, as it was his own; and his wife and child were in bed, but they might do as they liked with the gate and toll-house.\n> Rebecca went to the door, and ordered her [Rebecca’s] daughters not to touch anything but the gate and the roof of the toll-house, and not to break the ceiling for fear the rain would harm the woman and child in bed.\n> In their hurry, however, to unroof the house, one of them slipped between the rafters, and his foot got through the ceiling.\n> Rebecca expressed her sorrow at the accident, as it might cause inconvenience to the gate-keeper.…\n\n> They behaved remarkably well to the gate-keeper, and frequently desired him and his wife not to be alarmed, as they would not injure them in the least; but at parting Rebecca desired him not to exact tolls at that gate any more.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nDuring the tax resistance campaign for women’s suffrage in the U.K., resisters were better able to use tax auctions as rally and propaganda opportunities thanks to the respectful relationships they had developed with the auctioneers.\nOn one occasion:\n\n> …the auctioneer opened the proceedings by declaring himself a convinced Suffragist, which attitude of mind he attributed largely to a constant contact with women householders in his capacity as tax collector.\n\nWhen Kate Raleigh’s property was seized by the tax collector:\n\n> Miss Raleigh naturally made use of the occasion for propaganda purposes, conversing with the tax collector for some time on the subject of Woman Suffrage, and presenting him with Suffrage literature, which he accepted.\n> Before taking his leave he expressed himself as, on the whole, in favour of women’s claims to enfranchisement.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Murray, Chris “Peacemakers Win!” \u003Ci>Peace Newsletter\u003C/i> (Syracuse Peace Council)

Stop paying your taxes and the government will stop ignoring you.”\n  Brian refuses to pay half of his federal income tax, a percentage he believes is roughly equivalent to the portion of income tax revenue that the government spends on militarist projects.\n  When taxes are due, he includes a letter with his tax return explaining his refusal, and he sends copies of his letter to his Congressional representatives and to his local newspaper.\n  When the government responds by adding interest and fines to his tax bill and by seizing the money from his bank account, he uses these occasions to send out a press release about his action and why he feels it is important.\n\n**Clara**\n: The bumper sticker on Clara’s car reads “It’ll be a great day when our schools get all the money they need and the Air Force has to hold a bake sale to buy a bomber.”\n  She’s trying to make this day come to pass by persuading the members of a national peace group she volunteers for to withhold their taxes from the government and redirect the money to schools themselves.\n  “If the government won’t use our tax dollars responsibly, we’ll just have to show them how it’s done,” she says.\n  “But to make this work, we need a lot of people to join us, and we need to be very practical in choosing techniques that really deprive the military-industrial complex of resources.”\n\n**Donald**\n: Donald notes that for a long time conscientious objectors to military service had to risk prison or worse before the government finally acknowledged that conscientious objectors have a right not to participate in war.\n  He hopes that his tax resistance will help persuade the government to acknowledge that this right also extends to taxpayers who are conscientiously opposed to \u003Cem>paying\u003C/em> for war.\n  He lobbies the government, asking it to create a “Peace Tax Fund” where conscientious taxpayers could deposit their taxes without fear that the money would be used for military spending.\n  Meanwhile he is pursuing a court appeal in which he asserts conscientious objection to military taxation is a Constitutional right.\n  “I would be happy to pay every cent I owe, even more,” he says, “if only I knew my money were not paying for war.”\n\nAmy, Brian, Clara, and Donald may sit in the same circle at a war tax resistance gathering.\nThey may take inspiration from some of the same exemplars and authors.\nYou may see them marching together and signing the same petitions.\nThey have a lot in common.\n\nBut because they have different motives and different goals, they may find it hard to rally around a common tactic or campaign.\n\nFor instance, when Brian thinks about Amy’s quiet, legal resistance, he wonders how she thinks she’s going to persuade the government to change its policies that way.\nBut Amy thinks, “I don’t refuse to kill people because I think that my refusal will be an effective protest against murder, but because it is wrong to murder.\nThat’s also how I feel about my taxes.”\n\nClara thinks of Brian’s experience of having his bank account raided each year by the Internal Revenue Service and wonders how Brian thinks he’s having any impact on military spending.\nBut Brian doesn’t have any ambitions of defunding the government.\nHe still hopes to persuade it to change, and thinks that an uncompromising position of total opposition would be neither persuasive nor successful.\n\nAmy looks at Donald’s lobbying and wonders why it is so important to him that the government \u003Cem>legalize\u003C/em> his conscience—isn’t conscience compelling enough without needing a law to agree with it?\nBut Donald hopes that legalizing conscientious objection will give it more respect and visibility, and will encourage more people to consider a question of conscience that only brave dissidents are willing to consider today.\nThe state of the law is a way of measuring society’s values, he thinks, and if the law recognizes conscientious objection to military taxation, this may mean society is more willing to recognize dissent from war as a proper role for its citizens.\n\nSuperficially these activists are all “war tax resisters”—using a similar tactic, with similar motives, and similar goals in mind.\nBut when you look closer you notice that their motives have important differences, their goals are not the same, and therefore the tactics that are appropriate for one might not be appropriate for another.\n\nDoes your campaign include multiple varieties of resister?\nIf so, you need to be sensitive to these different aspirations, and not assume that a tactic that is attractive to some will seem compelling (or even sensible) to all.\n\nYou may look at some of the tactics described in this book and think “what possible good could that do?”\nIf so, remind yourself that different tactics are best for different goals, and consider that a tactic that looks useless to you may still have some use to another variety of resister.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Zahn, Franklin “Tax Refusal, Law, and Order” \u003Ci>Friends Journal\u003C/i> 1

Vallabhbhai’s speeches in pamphlet form and to distribute them free to the agriculturalists all over the taluka.…\n> The arrangement answered most admirably, the villagers waiting anxiously for the \u003Ci>patrikas\u003C/i> [pamphlets] every morning and devouring the contents with avidity.\n> All the Gujarati and almost all the English dailies of Bombay reproduced them \u003Ci>verbatim\u003C/i>, and as the movement gathered force, every important town and village in Gujarat began to get copies of the bulletin with the result that over and above ten thousand copies distributed in Bardoli, four thousand copies were subscribed to by places outside.\n\nBecause the movement relied on its own periodical literature, it also needed its own team to handle distribution.\nThis was laborious work, but the movement could take advantage of it for two-way communication and for intelligence gathering.\nIn the course of describing the organizational structure of the nonviolent resistance army, Desai noted:\n\n> [U]nder these officers were privates ready to march anywhere and everywhere, at any hour of the night and day, and ready to do the lowliest of duties, from carrying a message to drawing water from the well.…\n> The round of duties of most of them began often as early as 3 A.M., when they started with their orders for the day to the various villages where they would distribute the daily news bulletins issued by the Publicity Bureau.…\n> All were to go amongst the peasants, acquaint themselves with their needs and difficulties, cheer them up, and explain to them the instructions of the Chief…\n\nThe commander of the tax strike was “ever on the move” delivering pep talks and propaganda in person, “often at midnight, and often at three or four places in a day.”\n\n> The Bardoli victory was not won by a miracle.\n> It was the inevitable fruit of patient and incessant toil, the inevitable result of the teaching that the Sardar wore himself out to impart day in and day out.\n> During the first two months he gave three days in the week to Bardoli, but as soon as the Ahmedabad Municipality released him, all his waking hours were given to the people of Bardoli, the day usually beginning at 5 P.M. and ending at 2 A.M., with four or five speeches a day on average.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Valentine Byler\n\nThe case of Valentine Byler, an Amish man who refused to participate in the American Social Security system for religious reasons, was remarkable for how it played out in the media.\nPart of this was due to the heavy-handedness of the IRS, which seized Byler’s horses out from under him as he was working his field.\nAsked about this, the IRS Chief of Collections said: “Plowing never occurred to me. I live in an apartment.”\n\nThe frame of thoughtless-urban-bureaucrats vs. godly-heartland-people attached itself to the story, and those editorialists across the country who were already skeptical of welfare state policies jumped on it.\n“What kind of ‘welfare’ is it,” editorialized the \u003Ci>New York Herald Tribune\u003C/i>, “that takes a farmer’s horses away at spring plowing time in order to dragoon a whole community into a ‘benefit’ scheme it neither needs nor wants, and which offends its deeply held religious scruples?”\n\nAs a result of press like this, Byler got letters of support from around the country.\nCongress eventually felt enough pressure that it carved out a legal exception for self-employed Amish people that exempts them from the Social Security law.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nAbby and Julia Smith were taxed excessively by an unscrupulous local government that they, as women, had no voice in electing.\nThey decided to resist, and they knew how to make their struggle attractive to the news media.\n\nJulia prepared a speech for the town council that fell on deaf ears—but she then released the text to the editor of a nearby newspaper, which reprinted it and compared the sisters to the American Revolutionaries who fought for the principle of “no taxation without representation.”\nAn accompanying editorial concluded:\n“It will not be creditable if Abby Smith and her sister are left to stand alone… to fight the battle of principle unaided.”\n\nSure enough, they received aid—rhetorical and practical—from many quarters.\n“[M]uch of the nation’s interest in the Glastonbury case was the work of Abby,” wrote Elizabeth George Speare in recapping the case, “who willingly took pen in hand to keep her public informed.\n…she seems to have welcomed every opportunity to recount, in her pungent style, a tale which lost nothing in constant retelling.”\n\nThe Women’s Tax Resistance League in the U.K. made sure to have speeches and propaganda ready to deliver at events like tax auctions that the media might cover.\nSuch speeches might become the core of a reporter’s coverage of such an event.\nDora Montefiore recalled how she and some of her fellow-activists worked to turn the “siege” of her home into a media phenomenon:\n\n> In 1904 and 1905 a bailiff had been put in my house, a levy of my goods had been made, and they had been sold at public auction in Hammersmith.\n> The result as far as publicity was concerned was half a dozen lines in the corner of some daily newspapers…\n>\n> When talking this over in 1906 with Theresa Billington and Annie Kenney, I told them that now we had the organisation of the W.S.P.U. [Women’s Social and Political Union] to back me up I would, if it were thought advisable, not only refuse to pay income tax, but would shut and bar my doors and keep out the bailiff, so as to give the demonstration more publicity and thus help to educate public opinion about the fight for the political emancipation of women which was going on.\n> They agreed that if I would do my share of passive resistance they would hold daily demonstrations outside the house as long as the bailiff was excluded and do all in their power outside to make the sacrifice I was making of value to the cause.…\n>\n> …From the day of this simple act of closing my door against the bailiff, an extraordinary change came over the publicity department of daily and weekly journalism towards this demonstration of passive resistance on my part…\n>\n> On the morning following the inauguration of the siege, Annie Kenney and Theresa Billington, with other members of the W.S.P.U., came round to see how we were getting on and to encourage our resistance.\n> They were still chatting from the pavement outside, while I stood on the steps of No. 32 Upper Mall, when there crept round from all sides men with notebooks and men with cameras, and the publicity stunt began.\n> These men had been watching furtively the coming and going of postmen and tradesmen.\n> Now they posted themselves in front, questioning the suffragists outside and asking for news of us inside.\n> They had come to make a “story” and they did not intend to leave until they had got their “story.”\n> One of them returned soon with a loaf of bread and asked Annie Kenney to hand it up over the wall to my housekeeper, whilst the army of men with cameras “snapped” the incident.\n> Some of them wanted to climb over the wall so as to be able to boast in their descriptions that they had been inside what they pleased to call “The Fort”; but the policeman outside (there was a policeman on duty outside during all the six weeks of a siege) warned them that they must not do this so we were relieved, in this respect, from the too close attention of eager pressmen.\n> But all through the morning notebooks and cameras came and went, and at one time my housekeeper and I counted no less than twenty-two pressmen outside the house.\n> A woman sympathiser in the neighbourhood brought during the course of the morning, a pot of home-made marmalade, as the story had got abroad that we had no provisions and had difficulty in obtaining food.\n> This was never the case as I am a good housekeeper and have always kept a store cupboard, but we accepted with thanks the pot of marmalade because the intentions of the giver were so excellent; but this incident was also watched and reported by the Press.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> First Intifada\n\nWhen I read stories from newspaper archives about the tax strike in Beit Sahour during the first intifada, I’m struck by how much more sympathetic the American press was toward the Palestinian people at that time.\nThey are depicted as human beings, with families and aspirations, and their grievances are taken seriously and explored and analyzed and given credence.\nThe contrast with the coverage in today’s media is stark.\n\nThis can partially be explained by the fact that most of the resisters in Beit Sahour were Palestinian \u003Cem>Christians\u003C/em>, and so did not trigger the anti-Muslim bias that shapes much of the English-language reporting from the area (one news account, for example, made much of the fact that the Israeli military had seized “Christian crosses carved of olivewood and the statuettes of the Good Shepherd and the Madonna” from one resister).\n\nBut the resisters in Beit Sahour were also media savvy:\nthey stuck to nonviolent tactics, which, besides being tactically sensible under the circumstances, also made the expected draconian Israeli crackdown seem particularly bullying; and they used slogans, like “no taxation without representation” that fell on sympathetic ears in the English-speaking world.\nA reporter noted, pointedly, that when the Israeli military lifted its siege of Beit Sahour, “hundreds of residents gathered at a central intersection to celebrate and to escort journalists to homes and shops from which troops had seized goods.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nDuring the campaign against Margaret Thatcher’s poll tax, the resistance movement successfully depicted the government’s tax as being particularly harmful to pensioners, the disabled, student nurses, families with live-in elderly relatives, and other such victims.\nThis made for a sympathetic media narrative.\n“Stories like this flooded both the national and local media,” writes movement historian Danny Burns.\n“One minute the focus was on the nurses, next on the disabled, then on the pensioners.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> American War Tax Resisters\n\nThe IRS pursues a publicity strategy in coordination with its enforcement actions.\nIt grades itself by how much press coverage it gets when it cracks down on a tax evader—“sending the message to taxpayers that violations of the Internal Revenue Code and related financial crimes are being investigated and prosecuted.”\nOne study estimated that for every dollar the government wins directly as the result of a well-publicized criminal tax conviction, it gets sixteen dollars from people who are scared into tax compliance by hearing the news.\n\nFor this reason the IRS tries to make sure the press is alerted about any criminal tax cases it thinks it will win.\nAnd of course the agency gives out its own spin on the case when it does so.\nSo it makes sense for tax resisters to be prepared with their own messages on such occasions.\n\n“Never let a lien, levy, seizure, auction, summons, Order to Show Cause, or indictment pass without taking the opportunity to publicize opposition,” advise the authors of the book \u003Ci>War Tax Resistance: A Guide to Withholding Your Support from the Military\u003C/i>:\n> The IRS is very sensitive to adverse public opinion.\n> It is probably the most disliked agency of the government.\n> You may be surprised at the amount of support and sympathy you will get from the general public and media when struggling against the IRS—if you take care to organize properly.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The Addiopizzo Movement\n\nHere is another example of activists creating their own media as the springboard for a public relations campaign.\nThe Addiopizzo movement, which is trying to get businesses in Sicily to stop paying \u003Ci>pizzo\u003C/i> taxes to the mafia, started with a clever propaganda campaign in Palermo that was well-designed to get tongues wagging:\n\n> [T]he group printed large stickers.\n> Designed to mimic the look of traditional Sicilian obituary notices, they bore one sentence:\n> “An entire people that pays \u003Ci>pizzo\u003C/i> is a people without dignity.”\n>\n> Residents woke on June 29, 2004, to find the stickers plastered in the city’s core.\n> The slogan suggested the death of their dignity for accepting the system of \u003Ci>pizzo\u003C/i>.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Desai, Mahadev \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i> (1929) pp. 57–58, 163–64, 168\n* Igou, Brad “Valentine Byler vs. the IRS: ‘Pay Unto Caesar—The Amish & Social Security’ ” \u003Ci>Amish Country News\u003C/i> 1999\n* Speare, Elizabeth George “Abby, Julia, and the Cows” \u003Ci>American Heritage\u003C/i> June 1957\n* Montefiore, Dora \u003Ci>From a Victorian to a Modern\u003C/i> (1925) chapter VI\n* Cowell, Alan “Beit Sahur Journal: In a Tax War, Even the Olivewood Dove Is Seized” \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> 11 October 1989\n* “Israel lifts siege on tax town” \u003Ci>The Glasgow Herald\u003C/i> 1 November 1989, p. 4\n* Burns, Danny \u003Ci>Poll Tax Rebellion\u003C/i> AK Press (1992), p. 19\n* Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration “Statistical Portrayal of the Criminal Investigation Function’s Enforcement Activities From Fiscal Year 2000 Through Fiscal Year 2006” 6 June 2007.

Honesty provides a stark moral contrast between your campaign and whatever institution you are opposing.\n\nIn \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i>, Mahadev Desai described how this played out in the Bardoli tax strike:\n\n> …a regular propaganda of mendacity was resorted to [by the Government].\n> The Government’s way and the people’s way presented a striking study in contrasts.\n> On one side there were secrecy, underhand dealings, falsehood, even sharp practice; on the other there were straight and manly speech, and straight action in broad daylight.\n\nThis contrast can make your campaign more appealing to potential resisters and to bystanders, and can increase the morale of the resisters in your campaign.\n\n### 2. Honesty itself is a threat to tyranny.\n\nThe way people signal their loyalty to tyranny is by participating in the lies that bolster its power.\nWhen everyone around you goes along with the lies, it feels like everyone is loyal to the tyrant.\nCzech dissident Václav Havel wrote of how this worked under communist tyranny:\n\n> Individuals need not believe all these mystifications, but they must behave as though they did, or they must at least tolerate them in silence, or get along well with those who work with them.\n> For this reason, however, they must live \u003Cem>within a lie\u003C/em>.\n> They need not accept the lie.\n> It is enough for them to have accepted their life with it and in it.\n> For by this very fact, individuals confirm the system, fulfil the system, make the system, \u003Cem>are\u003C/em> the system.\n\nBut, he said, people may start to refuse:\n\n> Living within the lie can constitute the system only if it is universal.\n> The principle must embrace and permeate everything.\n> There are no terms whatsoever on which it can coexist with living within the truth, and therefore everyone who steps out of line \u003Cem>denies it in principle and threatens it in its entirety\u003C/em>.\n\nTolstoy went further, and claimed that radical honesty not only threatens tyrants but constitutes a revolution:\n\n> No feats of heroism are needed to achieve the greatest and most important changes in the existence of humanity; neither the armament of millions of soldiers, nor the construction of new roads and machines, nor the arrangement of exhibitions, nor the organization of workmen’s unions, nor revolutions, nor barricades, nor explosions, nor the perfection of aërial navigation; but a change in public opinion.\n>\n> And to accomplish this change no exertions of the mind are needed, nor the refutation of anything in existence, nor the invention of any extraordinary novelty; it is only needful that we should not succumb to the erroneous, already defunct, public opinion of the past, which governments have induced artificially; it is only needful that each individual should say what he really feels or thinks, or at least that he should not say what he does not think.\n>\n> And if only a small body of the people were to do so at once, of their own accord, outworn public opinion would fall off us of itself, and a new, living, real opinion would assert itself.\n> And when public opinion should thus have changed without the slightest effort, the internal condition of men’s lives which so torments them would change likewise of its own accord.\n>\n> One is ashamed to say how little is needed for all men to be delivered from those calamities which now oppress them; it is only needful not to lie.\n\n### 3. Honesty keeps your campaign from deluding itself.\n\nIn a tax resistance campaign, as in any activist campaign, there are frequently temptations to take short-cuts.\nRather than winning a victory after a tough and uncertain struggle, you can \u003Cem>declare\u003C/em> victory early and try to capitalize on the resulting morale boost.\nOr, rather than doing something practical that takes a lot of work, you can do something quick and symbolic that “makes a powerful statement.”\nOr, rather than fighting for goals that are worth achieving, you can pick goals that are easily achievable but that aren’t really worth fighting for.\n\nRadical honesty gets you in the habit of avoiding such temptations.\nBy facing your situation forthrightly, and by evaluating your tactics unflinchingly and without self-flattery, you are more apt to make effective decisions.\n\n### 4. Honesty is itself a good thing worth contributing to.\n\nIf you conduct your campaign in a radically honest way, you contribute to a cultural atmosphere of trust and straightforward communication.\nIn this way, even if you do not succeed in the other goals of your tax resistance campaign, you still may have some residual positive effect on the world around you.\n\n### 5. Honesty means there’s a lot you no longer have to worry about.\n\nWhen you practice radical honesty, you don’t have to worry about keeping your stories straight, about leaks of information that might cast doubt on your credibility, about information security, or about spies and informers in your midst who might blab your secrets to the authorities.\nThis leaves you free to spend your energy and attention playing offense instead of defense.\n\nWhen Gandhi heard concerns that government agents had infiltrated the Indian independence movement, he wrote:\n\n> This desire for secrecy has bred cowardice amongst us and has made us dissemble our speech.\n> The best and the quickest way of getting rid of this corroding and degrading Secret Service is for us to make a final effort to think everything aloud, have no privileged conversation with any soul on earth and to cease to fear the spy.\n> We must ignore his presence and treat everyone as a friend entitled to know all our thoughts and plans.\n> I know that I have achieved most satisfactory results from evolving the boldest of my plans in broad daylight.\n> I have never lost a minute’s peace for having detectives by my side.\n> The public may not know that I have been shadowed throughout my stay in India.\n> That has not only not worried me but I have even taken friendly services from these gentlemen: many have apologized for having to shadow me.\n> As a rule, what I have spoken in their presence has already been published to the world.\n> The result is that now I do not even notice the presence of these men and I do not know that the Government is much the wiser for having watched my movements through its secret agency.\n\n## What’s the Catch?\n\nWhat’s the catch?\nFor one thing, for a campaign to be radically honest it needs to have fairly tight control over its message.\nNot just anyone can be a spokesperson, but only those with the talent to speak precisely and to cut through the sorts of baloney that characterize political debate in this era of spin doctors and professional pundits.\n\nAnother difficulty is that if your campaign already has a credibility problem, it’s going to take a lot of radical honesty to dig you out of that hole.\n\nAlso, it seems that at least some of the benefits of radical honesty only emerge when it has become really radical and pervasive.\nHalf-hearted gestures of radical honesty are just another form of machiavellian communication.\nIf you’re not prepared to go all the way, it may not be to your advantage to put in the extra effort.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Sissela Bok’s \u003Ci>Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life\u003C/i> (1989) has some good food for thought on this subject.\n  Bok thinks that there are some good excuses for lying, but that in general people tend to be far too willing to justify lies, and that their justifications typically don’t stand up to scrutiny.\n  Even the more sophisticated ethical defenses of lying tend to look only at the isolated instance of the particular lie and its effect on the person or persons being directly deceived.\n  Bok makes a good case for why we also need to take into account the effects of the lie on the character of the liar, on the culture of communication and trust, and on bystanders.\n* It’s not just activist campaigns that can suffer from self-delusion, of course.\n  For example, during the Vietnam war, war-theorists working for the United States government cleverly created simulations and projections for victory using the best data they had at their disposal—but this data was being systematically falsified by other elements of the government who were using deceit tactically as their own best guess as how to win the war.\n  In this way these lies doubled-back and amplified the defeat and shame of the American war on Vietnam.\n* Desai, Mahadev \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i>

influence, you improve society.\nThe way Thoreau put it—“It is not so important that many should be as good as you, as that there be some absolute goodness somewhere; for that will leaven the whole lump.”\n\nBy being virtuous in an out-of-the-ordinary way, you encourage people to call ordinary vices into question and you force the devil’s advocates to show themselves by coming to the devil’s defense.\nThoreau was convinced that one person was enough to leaven the loaf:\n\n> [I]f one thousand, if one hundred, if ten men whom I could name,—if ten \u003Cem>honest\u003C/em> men only,—aye, if \u003Cem>one\u003C/em> \u003Cstrong>honest\u003C/strong> man, in this State of Massachusetts, \u003Cem>ceasing to hold slaves\u003C/em>, were actually to withdraw from this copartnership, and be locked up in the county jail therefor, it would be the abolition of slavery in America.\n\nHennacy said that his “work was not that of an organizer but of a Sower to sow the seeds.”\n\n> We really can’t change the world.\n> We really can’t change other people!\n> The best we can do is to start a few thinking here and there.\n> The way to do this, if we are sincere, is to \u003Cem>change ourselves!\u003C/em>\n\n> \u003Cem>When they are ready for it\u003C/em> [my emphasis, again], the rich, the bourgeois intellectual, the bum, and even the politician and the clergy may have an awakening of conscience because of the uncompromising seeds of Christian Anarchism which we are sowing.\n\nYou have a plan to reform the world?\nAs the saying goes: “show me, don’t tell me.”\nThoreau:\n\n> The Reformer who comes recommending any institution or system to the adoption of men, must not rely solely on logic and argument, or on eloquence and oratory for his success, but see that he represents one pretty perfect institution in himself…\n>\n> I ask of all Reformers, of all who are recommending Temperance, Justice, Charity, Peace, the Family, Community or Associative life, not to give us their theory and wisdom only, for these are no proof, but to carry around with them each a small specimen of his own manufactures, and to despair of ever recommending anything of which a small sample at least cannot be exhibited:—that the Temperance man let me know the savor of Temperance, if it be good, the Just man permit me to enjoy the blessings of liberty while with him, the Community man allow me to taste the sweets of the Community life in his society.\n\nToo many reformers think they can reform the rottenness of the system the people are sustaining without removing the rot from the people who sustain the system.\nThoreau thought differently:\n“The disease and disorder in society are wont to be referred to the false relations in which men live one to another, but strictly speaking there can be no such thing as a false relation if the condition of the things related is true.\nFalse relations grow out of false conditions.…\nIt is not the worst reason why the reform should be a private and individual enterprise, that perchance the evil may be private also.”\n\nSo often we hear of a Big Plan that, were it enacted as designed, would solve the Big Problems.\nBut the problem with the big plans is that they never seem to get enacted, or if they do, they never seem to work as designed, as the same old problems show up in new guises.\nMeanwhile the planners waste their time and energy and don’t change what \u003Cem>is\u003C/em> changeable.\nTolstoy put it this way:\n\n> If a man drinks, and I tell him that he can himself stop drinking and must do so, there is some hope that he will pay attention to me; but if I tell him that his drunkenness forms a complex and difficult problem, which we, the learned, will try to solve in our meetings, all the probabilities are that he, waiting for the solution of the problem, will continue to drink.\n> The same is true of the false and intricate scientific, external means for the cessation of war, like the international tribunals, the court of arbitration, and other similar foolish things, when we with them keep in abeyance the simplest and most essential means for the cessation of war, which is only too obvious to anybody.\n> For people who do not need war not to fight we need no international tribunals, no solution of questions, but only that the people who are subject to deception should awaken and free themselves from that spell under which they are.\n> This means for the abolition of war consists in this, that the men who do not need war, who consider a participation in war to be a sin, should stop fighting.\n\nAn alcoholic who spoke with Hennacy had much the same sentiment:\n“[Alcoholics Anonymous] fixed me up.\nYou are right in not wanting to change the world by violence; the change has to come with each person first.”\n\nMany ostensible opposition movements are full of people who pay with their taxes for what they they oppose with their voices—like drunks meeting in a tavern at happy hour to organize a prohibition movement that will solve their alcohol problem.\n\nOne of the saddest examples of a personal revolution lost is that of the American revolutionary Thomas Jefferson.\nHis theory was sound.\nRead these uncompromising anti-slavery words from his draft of the Declaration of Independence:\n\n> He [the King] has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither.\n> This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of \u003Cem>infidel\u003C/em> powers, is the warfare of the \u003Cem>Christian\u003C/em> king of Great Britain.\n> Determined to keep open a market where \u003Cem>men\u003C/em> should be bought and sold, he has prostituted his negative [veto] for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce.\n> And that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded them: thus paying off former crimes committed against the \u003Cem>liberties\u003C/em> of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the \u003Cem>lives\u003C/em> of another.\n\nJefferson frequently attacked the evil of slavery, not only because of the obvious evil that it was against those enslaved, but also because it degraded everyone by presenting a despotic institution as natural and reasonable.\nIn one of his musings on slavery, he wrote:\n“There must doubtless be an unhappy influence on the manners of our people produced by the existence of slavery among us.\nThe whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions, the most unremitting despotism on the one part, and degrading submissions on the other.”\n\nIf you asked him, he’d tell you that nobody hated slavery more than he.\nIn fact, he did say as much, when he apologetically declined to join an abolitionist society (because he was representing the U.S. government in France at the time and thought such membership would be incompatible with his job):\n“You know that nobody wishes more ardently to see an abolition not only of the trade, but of the condition of slavery.”\n\nThomas Jefferson owned 187 people, enslaved to him.\nUpon his death, he had a few emancipated.\nThe others were auctioned off to other slaveholders to pay his debts.\nIn spite of Jefferson’s prophetic vision, his zeal, the effectiveness of his many efforts, and his professed love of liberty, he could not and did not end slavery in America.\nHe could have, but did not, return liberty to his 187 slaves.\n\nThis should worry us.\nAre we too waiting like Jefferson—willing to spend our entire lives waiting for the critical mass, the Hollywood Gandhi, the benevolent aliens from Atlantis, the paradigm shift, the noble third-party candidate, the Sign From God, that one impossible thing that needs to happen before we ourselves can actually do what we know is right and free our slaves?\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* The lump-leavening quote comes from Thoreau’s [“Resistance to Civil Government”](https://sniggle.net/TPL/index5.php?entry=rtcg).\n  The “a little leavening leavens the whole lump” metaphor appears in several places in the Bible.\n  Usually, the leavening represents corruption and the metaphor is something like the more modern “one rotten apple can spoil the whole barrel.”\n  But Jesus used the metaphor in a much more positive way, saying that “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.”\n\n  Thoreau’s “ten honest men” also hearkens back to the Bible, in this case the story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.\n  When God threatened to destroy the cities, Abraham asked him if he would still be willing to destroy them if there were fifty righteous people there who would be destroyed with the rest.\n  God said in that case, he’d back off.\n  Then Abraham said, what about 45? how about 40? 30? 20? 10?\n  He managed to negotiate God down to ten before God got sick of the act and walked away.\n  Alas, there weren’t even that many righteous people, so God torched the place.\n\n  For that matter, Thoreau’s note that in his speech to a mostly-shocked crowd “the seed has not all fallen in stony & shallow ground” also has Biblical roots, as does his “do not let your right hand know what your left hand does” remark.\n  Even if you’re not a Christian, you almost have to be familiar with the King James Bible just to acquire the vocabulary of metaphors you need to understand the centuries of English-language literature that came after.\n\n  By using phrases like these and drawing on the stories they evoked in his audience, Thoreau is reminding them that his arguments, while challenging, are rooted in a tradition they can understand and already are familiar with.\n  As good Christians, they have probably already tried to imagine the Kingdom of God as being like a little yeast leavening a whole loaf, or whether or not they are the sort of good ground on which the seeds of good teaching would land and flourish, or whether if angels came to destroy their town they would be among the ten righteous people who could argue for them to spare it.\n* Hennacy, Ammon “The Old Pioneer” \u003Ci>The Book of Ammon\u003C/i> (1970) p. 92\n* Hennacy, Ammon “We Have the Kind of World

Join few if any.\n\nPerhaps, contrary to what the organizers of the world are always telling us, the key to curing society’s ills is not necessarily to \u003Cem>organize\u003C/em> at all.\nYou don’t need to build a majority, or a critical mass, or a disciplined revolutionary vanguard.\nJust get your own house in order and commit yourself to your own personal revolution—that’s the most crucial, practical, and effective thing you can be doing right now.\n\nSo while in the previous chapters I concentrated on tactics that help tax resistance \u003Cem>movements\u003C/em> succeed, I also want to consider how tax resisters can succeed even without being part of a movement.\n\n“The one-man revolution” that Frost champions is the answer to the question posed so frequently by erstwhile radicals and reformers: “What can \u003Cem>just one person\u003C/em> do?”\nI suspect that some ask because they hope that the answer will be “nothing, so don’t sweat it.”\nThey think the revolution that will finally put things right is scheduled for later—when the masses see the light… when a crisis comes… when we find a charismatic leader… when we unite the factions under one banner… when… when… when…\n\nThe solo revolutionary says: no, the revolution starts here and now.\nThere are five reasons why the personal revolution might be the most effective one:\n\n1. With the personal revolution, success is in reach.\n   It may not be easy, but you can win this revolution with your own effort.\n   Furthermore, whether or not you succeed, the struggle itself is the right thing to do.\n1. You don’t need to wait for a majority.\n   You don’t have to water down your message to win mass appeal or group consensus.\n   You can start immediately from a firm platform of integrity and honesty.\n   This also makes you more self-reliant so that you can endure challenges better, which helps you to be more effective than those revolutionaries who always have to check to see if the rest of the pack is still with them.\n1. Political revolutions without personal revolutions are a poor way to make enduring radical change—they tend to just change the faces of the clowns running the circus while leaving intact the relationship between the government and its subjects that is really the root of the problem.\n1. The world sometimes is changed radically and for the better by the efforts and example of a single, one-in-a-million character.\n   But the first step is not to set out to change the world, but to \u003Cem>develop such a character\u003C/em>.\n1. Although you engage in a \u003Cem>solo\u003C/em> revolution, this doesn’t mean you are alone: you will “leaven the loaf” and cause all society to rise, you will attract other personal revolutionaries to your side, and you will sow the seeds that inspire others.\n\nThis chapter asks you to consider the personal revolution and in particular the arguments in its favor from two of its strongest advocates: Ammon Hennacy and Henry David Thoreau, both of whom included tax resistance in their revolutions.","src/content/docs/therevolutioniswithinyou/introduction.mdx","7efb5205673b1001","therevolutioniswithinyou/withoutitotherrevolutionsfail",{"id":235,"data":237,"body":244,"filePath":245,"digest":246,"deferredRender":16},{"title":238,"description":239,"editUrl":16,"head":240,"template":52,"sidebar":241,"pagefind":16,"draft":39},"Without the Personal Revolution, No Other Revolution Is Worth It","Political revolutions, says Ammon Hennacy, have “only changed masters.”",[],{"order":242,"hidden":39,"attrs":243},5,{},"\u003Cdiv style=\"width: fit-content; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\">\n\n>  Some, belike,\u003Cbr />\n> Groaning with restless enmity, expect\u003Cbr />\n> All change from change of constituted power;\u003Cbr />\n> As if a Government had been a robe,\u003Cbr />\n> On which our vice and wretchedness were tagged\u003Cbr />\n> Like fancy-points and fringes, with the robe\u003Cbr />\n> Pulled off at pleasure.

Tax paying is the norm.\n1. Taxes are spent wisely for things of public benefit.\n1. Tax evaders will be caught and dealt with harshly.\n\nThese beliefs are mutually self-reinforcing:\nThe more people hold these beliefs, the more tax compliant they are—and the more tax compliant people are, the more these beliefs seem plausible.\n\nFor this reason, governments work hard to create a culture of taxpayer compliance.\nIf they succeed, compliance develops its own momentum and is easier to maintain.\nIt takes a lot less work for the government to keep taxpayer compliance from slipping from 90% to 80% than it does for the government to raise taxpayer compliance from 80% to 90%.\n\nIf taxpayer compliance is high, taxpayers convince themselves of the three beliefs.\nA taxpayer may ask: “Why am I paying?” and then assume “Well, I must have good reasons: it’s because I’m a good citizen, and I want to contribute to useful things, and besides if I don’t I’ll get caught.\nEverybody knows this.”\n\nIf taxpayer compliance is low, however, taxpayers have to \u003Cem>be\u003C/em> convinced—they ask instead: “Am I getting played for a fool?”\n\nGovernments spend a lot of effort trying to understand the psychology of taxpayer compliance and they engage in a lot of propaganda and other forms of manipulation in order to convince people to comply.\n\n![Donald Duck looks at a sign that reads “March 15: Income tax due. First payment. U.S. Treasury Save For Taxes Plan.”](../../../assets/donald-duck.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>Donald Duck learns the importance of paying income taxes in \u003Ci>The Spirit of ’43\u003C/i>\u003C/figcaption>\n\nOne example is the World War II-era Disney short film \u003Ci>The Spirit of ’43\u003C/i> in which a skeptical Donald Duck learns that it will take “taxes to sink the Axis.”\nAnother is the 1955 short film \u003Ci>The Tsippori Affair\u003C/i>, produced by Israel’s propaganda department, in which audiences were shown the horrible things that would happen if nobody paid their taxes (for example, the schools would close and children would lounge about playing cards, drinking wine, and smoking cigarettes).\n\n### Belief #1: Tax Paying Is the Norm\n\nHere is an example of how the U.S. government props up this belief:\nEvery year the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) conducts a “Taxpayer Attitude Survey” of 1,500 randomly-phoned Americans.\nThe survey contains carefully-loaded questions like these (emphasis mine):\n\n* “How much, if any, do you think is an acceptable amount to \u003Cem>cheat\u003C/em> on your income taxes?”\n* “[Do you agree that] it is every American’s civic duty to pay their \u003Cem>fair share\u003C/em> of taxes?”\n* “[Do you agree that] everyone who \u003Cem>cheats\u003C/em> on their taxes should be held accountable?”\n\nPredictably, people overwhelmingly respond that cheating is bad and fair shares are good.\nThe IRS then puts out a press release that trumpets these results and claims they demonstrate that Americans overwhelmingly believe everybody should pay what the government demands.\nTypically the lazy news media go along with it, composing stories that follow the press release script.\n\nA tax resistance campaign can attack this “taxpaying is the norm” belief by reinforcing a different message:\n“Lots of people don’t pay taxes:\nRich people with off-shore bank accounts—big corporations with crafty lobbyists—people who know the right people in the right places—and even ordinary people like you and me who know how the game is played.\nIf you’re paying everything the government says you owe, you’re paying a lot more than your ‘fair share.’ ”\n\nOne way you can spread this message is with stories about well-known people who successfully avoid their taxes (there always seem to be plenty of stories like these), and also stories about resisters and evaders who are “ordinary people like yourself.”\n\nFor example, when President Obama’s first Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, was being confirmed by the Senate, the news came out that he had failed to declare some of his income on his tax returns and had taken some improper deductions.\nCases like this reinforce the idea that everybody is trying to pull one over on the tax collector—even the fellow in charge of the tax collection agency himself!\n\n![licensed from Ken Mayer under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license](../../../assets/billionaires-for-bush.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>“Billionaires for Bush” protesters\u003C/figcaption>\n\nA group of war tax resisters from the Bangor (Maine) Peace & Justice Center used this tactic in a tax day action:\nThey put on formal gowns and tuxedos, rented a white stretch limousine, and went to the dual post office/federal building “to perform a bit of satire-filled street theater.”\nCalling themselves the “Rich People’s Liberation Front,” they meant their performance “to expose the huuuge tax breaks which America’s corporations and our wealthiest citizens receive.”\nThey passed out candy suckers to the people who were lining up to pay their taxes—“Suckers for the suckers!”\nAnother group, calling itself “Billionaires for [U.S. President George W.] Bush,” protested in tuxedos, carrying signs reading “Taxes are not for everyone” and “Thank you for paying our fair share.”\n\nSimply coming “out of the closet” as a tax resister can help.\nIf people stereotype tax resisters as antisocial eccentrics who are nothing like themselves, they’ll be reluctant to resist—but if they see ordinary people like their neighbors resisting, they may be willing to consider the idea afresh.\nOne journalist who interviewed a tax evader was surprised to find that he was just an ordinary guy:\n\n> In my mind, the Tax Evader has a scraggly beard, eats a lot of salt pork and beans, and owns either a copy of Thoreau or some antigovernment tract self-published in Montana.\n> Just as the Tax Evader doesn’t believe in taxes, he also doesn’t go for showers.\n> He is suspicious, owns at least one gun and tends to believe the IRS is always sneaking up on him.\n> His body is gnarled and contorted by the lumps of cash he stores in his mattress.\n> Because I don’t want to be the Tax Evader, I pay my taxes.\n\nCan it really be that some people pay their taxes because they’re afraid that otherwise they’ll transform into the Unabomber by some bizarre alchemy?\nApparently so.\n\n### Belief #2: Taxes Are Spent Wisely\n\nIn 2012, an IRS advisory group surveyed two groups of American “sole proprietors” (independent contractors or people who run small businesses).\nOne of these groups consisted of taxpayers the agency viewed as being most likely to be cheating on their taxes, and the other group was at the other end of the spectrum, thought by the agency to be the most fastidious about reporting their income and paying what was due.\n\nThey asked a series of questions to try to draw out what attitudes and characteristics were correlated with belonging to each group.\nThe answers were surprising:\n\n* Were the less-compliant taxpayers less likely to think tax evaders would get caught?\n  \u003Cem>No\u003C/em>—in fact just the opposite.\n* Were they more likely to think that tax evasion is financially advantageous—in other words, that tax evaders are likely to come out ahead?\n  \u003Cem>No again:\u003C/em> they were \u003Cem>more\u003C/em> likely to think tax evaders were taking a bad gamble and would probably end up worse off.\n* Were they more likely to think that their business competitors were cheating on \u003Cem>their\u003C/em> taxes and that therefore they had to cheat to stay competitive?\n  \u003Cem>No:\u003C/em> actually the \u003Cem>more\u003C/em>-compliant taxpayers were more likely to suspect their peers of being tax evaders.\n* Maybe the less-compliant group just didn’t think there was anything wrong with tax evasion?\n  \u003Cem>No:\u003C/em> fully 97% of them claimed to believe that everybody ought to report all of their income and pay all of their taxes dutifully.\n\nWhat really distinguished the less-compliant group were two things:\n\n1. They had a more negative impression of the government and the IRS (“For example, respondents from the low-compliance group were more likely to report that the government is too big and wastes tax dollars, that tax laws are unfair, and that the IRS is unfair”).\n1. They were more likely to be active participants in community groups, and to believe that other people in those groups shared these negative appraisals of the government.\n\nWhile a cynic might suspect that economic self-interest or fear of the long arm of the law are at the forefront of people’s minds when they decide whether or not to pay their taxes, this study shows that what really makes the difference is whether they feel they’re getting their money’s worth or whether the government is giving them a square deal.\n\nThe government is always eager to draw your attention when it spends your money on something nice.\nThere’s hardly a bridge, library, overpass, park, or other publicly-funded thing in my hometown that doesn’t have a plaque attached to it somewhere that lists the names of the city councillors and mayor who signed off on it—although that’s about all they had to do to get their names in brass.\n\nAnd whenever tax revenue threatens to fall, those government departments that fear budget cuts will quickly rush out press releases saying that the most popular parts of their budgets will certainly be the first ones hurt.\nIn the United States, this tactic has come to be known as “The Washington Monument Ploy” since 1969, when the head of the U.S. National Park Service responded to budget cuts by eliminating public access to popular attractions like the Washington Monument and the Grand Canyon for two days a week until Congress restored the funding.\n\nWhile the government is busily reminding people of the good things it does with your tax money, you need to make sure the opposite message gets through loud and clear:\n“The government squanders your hard-earned money by spending it wastefully and by giving padded government contracts to well-connected insiders.\nThanks to the government, undeserving and crooked people are getting rich at the expense of hard-working taxpayers.”\n\nYou can do this by spreading the news of government corruption and spending boondoggles (you won’t have much trouble finding good examples).\n\nYou may also find it helpful to contrast the way the government is \u003Cem>actually\u003C/em> spending its budget with the way people wish it were.\nAmerican war tax resistance groups often hold what they call “penny polls.”\nThey set up a table in a public space and invite passers-by to drop pennies into columns marked with certain federal budget categories: military, health & welfare, environment, education, and so forth.\nThe passers-by are asked, in effect: pretend that you are deciding how to spend the country’s tax revenue—where do you think it should go?\nAs the pennies rise in the columns, this creates a sort of vote, by the congress of passers-by, on what they think the country’s spending priorities should be.\nThey are then invited to compare their priorities to the real numbers in the budget.\nThe contrast is usually very discouraging.\n\n![Two side-by-side pie charts, one labeled “My Penny budget” and the other “How the 2012 U.S. budget allocates funds”](../../../assets/penny-poll.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>an on-line “penny poll” presented participants with pie charts that contrasted their spending priorities with actual U.S. federal spending\u003C/figcaption>\n\nThe Mennonite Central Committee turned the penny poll idea into an on-line game, and another website put together something similar:\na $3 trillion dollar shopping spree to give Americans an idea of what kind of cool things their country could be investing in if the government weren’t spending so much of their money on war.\n\nAmerican Libertarian Party activists often will hand out fake million dollar bills, each one printed with an estimate of how quickly the U.S. government spends that much money.\nOne American war tax resistance group held a tax day protest in which they labeled the mailboxes at the post office with the names of military contractors like Lockheed-Martin, Halliburton, and Bechtel, as a way of pointing out where the tax money was really going to end up.\nAds in the \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> before tax day, 1970, read “April 15th is ‘Support the Pentagon’ Day.”\nUnder that headline was a cartoon featuring a hapless taxpayer with a bit in his mouth and a load of generals, admirals, and armaments riding on his back.\n\nAwareness of government spending is somewhat related to what tax wonks call the “salience” of taxation—that is, how aware you are of the hand that is picking your pocket.\nYour income tax would be very salient if you had to write a check to the government every couple of weeks.\nBut if the money is automatically withheld from your paycheck before you get your hands on it, it’s less salient.\nIt would be less salient still if the tax were invisibly included in the price of the goods you buy.\nGovernments are eager to find ways to tax people in ways that make them less aware that they’re being taxed, because the less you’re aware of it the less you’ll complain (or resist).\nFor this reason, people hoping to \u003Cem>promote\u003C/em> tax evasion should try to \u003Cem>improve\u003C/em> people’s consciousness of being taxed.\n\nFor example, the Tax Foundation would raise a ballyhoo every year about what it calls “Tax Freedom Day”—“the day when the [United States] as a whole has earned enough money to pay off its total tax bill for the year.”\nThis date arrived about the same time of year as when federal income tax returns are due, which increased the press coverage.\nThe Foundation hopes that on Tax Freedom Day people will remember all of the work that they have done since January 1st, and will realize resentfully how much they’ve been working to earn money for the politicians and their priorities.\n\n### Belief #3: Tax Evaders Will Be Caught\n\nIn the weeks before tax day the IRS usually breathlessly announces indictments against famous people and big-time tax evaders.\nThe implicit message: don’t think of stepping out of line because you’re sure to get caught.\nAnecdotes speak louder than statistics when the government tries to convince people that tax resistance is a dangerous pastime.\n\nBut you can fight back with anecdotes of your own (and often statistics, too, if it comes down to that).\n“Evaders usually get away with it,” you can say.\nPublicize examples of people (or businesses) who have been resisting or evading for a long time and getting away with it.\n\nAmerican war tax resister Wally Nelson was fond of carrying a sign or sandwich-board reading “Haven’t Paid Taxes Since 1948” (he died in 2002, and still hadn’t paid).\nThe unwritten but implicit continuation of the message is “…and they haven’t caught me yet, and I’m not afraid of them!”\nHis sign was an instant rejoinder to the fear that tax resistance is a guaranteed ticket to prison.\n\nOn a few occasions tax resisters have turned themselves in to the authorities to show how little they are afraid of prosecution.\nFor example, in Australia’s Northern Territory in 1921, “the residents drew up a monster petition, which almost everybody signed, and insisted on the government standing up to its own laws by taking action against them.\nThey also defied the government to put them into jail.”\nAnd in 2000, three war tax resisters went to the IRS headquarters in Washington to turn themselves in.\n“If the resisters are not arrested and prosecuted,” Mary Loehr of NWTRCC said (and they weren’t, and still haven’t been), “it will expose the myth that people go to jail for not paying their taxes.”\n\n### These Attacks Are Also Mutually Reinforcing\n\nNote that these attacks on the beliefs that reinforce tax compliance are also mutually reinforcing:\nThe less people hold these beliefs, the less compliant they will be.\nAnd the less compliant people are, the less plausible these beliefs seem.\n\nYale professor James C. Scott studied resistance to government-mandated tithing in Malaysia (and elsewhere).\nHe noted that once tax resistance “has become a customary practice it generates its own expectations about what is permissible [and] raises the political and administrative costs for any regime that subsequently decides it will enforce the rules in earnest.\nFor everyday resisters there is safety in numbers and successful resistance builds its own momentum.”\n\n## The Direct Approach\n\nThe examples I have given mostly concern ways of promoting an atmosphere in which tax evasion seems like a good idea.\nBut there are also more direct ways people can assist in the tax evasion of others.\nI’ve already mentioned the tactic of paying in cash so that your transactions leave less of a paper trail for the government to follow.\n\n\u003CAside type=\"tip\" title=\"See also\">\n[Switch to Cash](../switchtocash/)\n\u003C/Aside>\n\nHere are a couple of others:\n\nYou can manufacture the paraphernalia of tax evasion.\nFor example, in Mexico City, you can visit a taco stand and walk away not only with lunch, but—for a small price—with fake receipts from a variety of restaurants, hotels, and stores, that you can then use to document spurious business expenses on your tax returns.\n\nYou can also spread rumors that a tax has been abolished.\nThis worked with great success at the time of the French Revolution, when such rumors became self-fulfilling prophecies.\nThis was also common in Czarist Russia, when people extrapolated from the propaganda-fuelled image of a benevolent Czar to conclude that a Czar so good \u003Cem>must\u003C/em> have abolished such awful taxes.\nAnd the United States has long had a cottage industry of people who are convinced that the real United States Constitution (America’s “benevolent Czar”) would never permit something as awful as the federal income tax.\n\n\u003CAside type=\"tip\" title=\"See also\">\n[Resonate with Myths, Legends, Folklore, or Historical Examples](../../../tacticsofeducationandpublicrelations/resonatewithlegends/)\n\u003C/Aside>\n\nAnother example of this is the “black tax credit” which became a craze in the United States for a while.\nIn 1993, newspaper columnist Lena Sherrod wrote that racial discrimination in the United States amounts to “a hidden Black tax”—and she estimated that Black households had each lost $43,209 to this tax since the days of Jim Crow.\nShe concluded her column with this tongue-in-cheek advice:\n\n> So when income-tax time rolls around, on line 59 of form 1040—which asks you to list “other payments”—simply enter $43,209 in “Black taxes” and compute accordingly.\n\nThe rumor mill took Sherrod’s smirking suggestion and transformed it into a bona fide urban legend.\nTens of thousands of people applied for the fictitious “black tax credit” and the IRS mistakenly granted tens of millions of dollars in refunds because of it.\n\n## Why Promote Tax Evasion?\n\nThis is a good example of where different varieties of tax resister will likely form very different opinions about the usefulness and wisdom of a tactic.\n\n\u003CAside type=\"tip\" title=\"See also\">\n[Varieties of Tax Resister](../varietiesofresister/introduction/)\n\u003C/Aside>\n\nIf your campaign is largely focused on protest and you were to encourage a bunch of people to evade their taxes for non-idealistic reasons it would be more likely to confuse your message than to enhance your protest.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are trying to deprive the government of resources as a way of forcing it to change, you may feel “the more, the merrier” and welcome tax evaders of all stripes.\nAnd if you are evading a tax as a conscientious objector, because you feel that paying the tax would itself be wrong, then you might feel that it’s better that people resist the tax selfishly and without knowing why than that they pay it from mistaken feelings of civic duty.\n\nThere is another possible problem with promoting tax evasion:\nIf your campaign aspires to reform or replace the existing government, should you succeed you may want those taxpayers to become compliant again.\nHowever, once you have eroded the beliefs that support taxpayer compliance, it’s hard to restore them.\n\nFor example, the state of Israel was founded after an independence campaign that included tax resistance against the British administration of Palestine.\nAfter Israel won its independence, it found that its citizens were reluctant to give up the habit of tax resistance, and the government had to put a great deal of effort into changing people’s minds.\nIn the United States, also, an independence struggle that prominently included tax resistance led to an independent government that almost immediately was faced with tax revolts like the Whiskey Rebellion, the Fries Rebellion, and the Shays Rebellion—often led by rebels who felt themselves to be acting in the patriotic, revolutionary tradition.\n\n\u003Chr

'@astrojs/starlight/components';\n\nTax resistance campaigns have amplified their impact by encouraging bank runs—that is, by asking people to withdraw their savings from banks.\nThis can be an attempt to reduce the assets available to the government, or to crash the economic system and thereby put pressure on the government more indirectly.\n\nIf the government forbids people from withdrawing their own money, or is unable to meet the sudden demand for currency, the credibility of the banking system is called into question, which can make it difficult for the regime to continue in business.\nOn the other hand, if the government allows people to withdraw their money, and if enough of them do so, this reduces the capital available to the banks, reduces their ability to confidently loan money (for instance, to the government), and can also shake the credibility of the system.\nThe government may respond to such a crisis by further degrading the currency, but the long-term effects of this can also serve to undermine the government.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Reform Act Agitation\n\nIn the final days of the agitation in the United Kingdom that led to the enacting of the Reform Act 1832, the movement in favor of the Act augmented its tax resistance campaign with a run on the Bank of England.\nLondon awoke one morning to find that the resistance movement had plastered the walls of the city with posters reading “\u003Cem>Go for Gold!\u003C/em>”\nAbout £1.8 million in gold was withdrawn from the Bank of England in the first days of the campaign (out of roughly £7 million in the Bank’s possession).\nSome commentators believe this to have been the turning point in the campaign.\nThe King soon invited Earl Grey to form a government with the authority to pass the Reform Act into law.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Anti-Czarists\n\nIn 1905, Russian socialists issued a manifesto in which they called on the proletariat to withdraw all of their savings from the banks in gold.\nThey billed this as an act of self-defense, saying that the government had squandered its reserves on speculation, leaving it no money to pay its bills.\nThe manifesto also emphasized its point by claiming that the wealthy had already sent their riches abroad to avoid the coming collapse.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> War Tax Resisters\n\nSome modern war tax resisters avoid depositing money in banks, but more as a boycott than a bank run—because banks operate as war financiers, because bank deposits are especially vulnerable to government seizure, and because the profits of banks are taxable.\n\nThe “Move Our Money” project claims that it has convinced Americans to shift more than half a billion dollars of their savings from banks to credit unions.\n“We stand against the bankers, CEOs, and lobbyists who have hijacked our democracy to serve themselves at the expense of everyone else.”\nIn the United States, this has tax resistance implications, as credit unions do not generate taxable profits as banks do.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and

tax.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Examples\" size=\"medium\" /> Petitions as Hopeful Requests\n\nEvery once in a while, there is hope that the petition itself may lead to a change in government policy.\n\nDuring the 17th century Croquant tax rebellions in France, the rebels sent carefully flattering petitions to the king that purported to assume, since the king was so wise and good, that the offensive tax hikes must have been snuck past his royal highness by deceitful advisors.\n\nIn 1723, religious nonconformists in Massachusetts successfully petitioned the King to free colonists who had been imprisoned for resisting a tax designed to fund the establishment church, and to affirm that Quakers in the colony should not have to pay taxes to maintain the ministers of another church.\n\nAfrican-American entrepreneur Paul Cuffee petitioned the Massachusetts legislature in 1780 and 1781 to complain that he was not permitted to vote, although he was a taxpayer (he also backed up his complaint by refusing to pay).\nHis petition arrived at a time when the state Constitution was in flux, and may have helped influence its drafters to omit a clause that would have restricted voting to white citizens.\n\nThe Rebecca Rioters, with their pseudonymous campaign of midnight toll-gate destruction, had the government nearly begging them to present a list of grievances they could at least pretend to address.\nMany groups of Welsh farmers did meet and draft lists of grievances.\nOnce, a \u003Ci>London Times\u003C/i> reporter gained the confidence of a Rebeccaite assembly, and then he set out their grievances for them in the form of a \u003Ci>Times\u003C/i> article describing the meeting.\nAnother group of farmers drafted a petition of their grievances that they sent to a government representative via a trusted intermediary.\nOn at least one occasion a group of parishes petitioned the Turnpike Trust that ran one of the offending toll gates, asking them to remove it, before Rebecca and her daughters took matters into their own hands.\n\nDuring the Annuity Tax struggle in Edinburgh, Scotland, “40,000 citizens of Edinburgh petitioned the House of Commons for [the Tax’s] abolition.\nThe town council, the magistrates of Canongate, the Merchant Company, the Anti-state-church and the Anti-annuity-tax Associations, all exerted themselves with the legislature and the government to procure its repeal, but all their influence was thwarted and set at nought, by the preposterous demands and unjust claims of the clergy.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Examples\" size=\"medium\" /> Petitions as Part of Larger Protests\n\nSome 14,000 American Amish petitioned Congress (putting aside that sect’s usual reluctance to participate in political affairs) asking the government to exempt them from the Social Security program, participation in which they felt was anti-Christian.\nAt the same time, some Amish were actively resisting the tax and suffering from government reprisals.\nCongress eventually did carve out an exemption for the Amish and certain other sects.\n\nThe Benares \u003Ci>hartal\u003C/i> of 1810–11 was successful in forcing the government to rescind a house tax.\nWhen it began, the residents of Benares abandoned the city and set up camp in an open field between Benares and Secrole, where the British administration was headquartered.\nThere, “[a] petition was presented to the magistrate, praying him to withdraw the odious impost, and declaring that the petitioners would never return to their homes until their application was complied with.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Petitions that Open Negotiations\n\nBefore launching the Bardoli tax strike, representatives from the resistance movement petitioned the government, asking for the concessions they would later demand via satyagraha.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Petitions as Propaganda Opportunities\n\nAbby Smith addressed the Glastonbury town council in 1873 to explain why she would not be paying her property tax to politicians who took advantage of her voteless condition.\nThe address fell on deaf ears in the council, but a newspaper published the text of her speech, and commented that “Abby Smith and her sister as truly stand for the American principle as did the citizens who ripped open the tea chests in Boston Harbor, or the farmers who leveled their muskets at Concord.”\nSoon the Smith case became a \u003Ci>cause célèbre\u003C/i> nationwide.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Petitions that Forewarn the Opponent\n\nThe hut tax war in Sierra Leone was preceded by petitions from a variety of groups asking the government to rescind the tax and explaining why the tax was felt to be particularly offensive.\nIn this case, the petitioning may have made things worse, as the government stubbornly pushed forward with the tax, but, because it was forewarned of opposition by the petitions, it “came to the conclusion that the exercise of force, peremptory, rapid, and inflexible, was the element to be relied on in making the scheme of taxation a success.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Rothbard, Murray “Peasants, Rise Up!

the stupid and cruel actions of the U.S. government.\nI became a tax resister.\nBut it was only after I started to resist that I became aware that I was joining a community of tax resisters and a historical lineage of resisters and resistance campaigns.\n\nThe more I connected with this community and researched this lineage the more interested I became in the history of tax resistance, its varieties, and the many creative tactics people have developed in the course of tax resistance campaigns.\nThe more I dug through the archives, the more interesting leads I found.\nAt the same time I was monitoring ongoing tax resistance actions around the world to see how they played out in today’s contexts.\nMeanwhile, I was blogging on the subject and using my blog as a way to categorize examples and to cross-reference common threads between them in the hope that some day I might be able to draw some useful conclusions from what I was finding.\n\nI published a tax resistance reader in 2008 that brought together documents from some of the more interesting examples of tax resistance campaigns from around the world and throughout history.\nI followed that by publishing a documentary history of war tax resistance among American Quakers up through the end of the 19th century.\n\nI spent two years on the administrative committee of the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee and learned more about the challenges of building a campaign out of a group of diversely-motivated tax resisters.\nThat group sent me to Colombia to an international conference on war tax resistance where I met some of our counterparts in other countries and I gave a presentation on the lessons war tax resisters can learn from historical tax resistance campaigns, which was my first

The law you break is itself immoral in some way, and that is the reason you are breaking it, or\n1. Although the law itself is unobjectionable, you are acting to prevent a wrong (or promote a good) in a way that requires you to incidentally break that law.\n\nSo, for instance, people violating the [Fugitive Slave Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850) by operating a station on the [Underground Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad) were breaking a law that they believed was itself an immoral law.\nOn the other hand, people who are arrested at blockades usually are tyically not opposed to laws against trespassing or blocking traffic or whatever they end up being charged with—rather, they are violating those laws incidentally while trying to prevent some greater harm.\n\nBut in the case of the people who were arrested blocking the street in San Francisco—and the same is true of much other so-called “civil disobedience” actions I’ve seen in recent years—they were neither asserting that laws against blocking traffic were immoral, nor did they believe that blocking traffic would prevent some greater harm that would be caused by allowing that traffic to proceed as normal.\n\n## What Is Getting Arrested For?\n\nInstead, \u003Cem>getting arrested\u003C/em>—whatever the charge and whatever the action leading to it—is itself the point of the action, and seems to be mostly a way of publicizing and amplifying one’s sense of outrage, anguish, or commitment.\nLess a civil disobedience action, it is more like the action of a mourner who wails and covers himself in ashes, or a penitent who whips himself with a lash.\nBeing arrested has become a sort of government-sponsored method of certifying the strength of one’s opinion.\n\nHere are some excerpts from a newspaper article on the arrests:\n\n> Earlier in the day, police arrested more than 100 protesters blocking Van Ness Avenue near the Civic Center after giving the chanting, sign-waving crowd more than an hour to vent its anger and sadness.\n> Many of those arrested were released in time to return for the evening event.\n>\n> Shortly after noon, officers began arresting anti-Prop. 8 protesters, starting with clergy members.\n> The arrests went so smoothly they seemed choreographed—which in a way they almost were, considering the police and protest organizers had been talking for days to make sure everything went smoothly and peacefully.\n>\n> “It’s the right thing to do,” Rabbi Sydney Mintz… said of her decision to protest Prop. 8, shortly before she was led off with wrists tied.\n>\n> Mintz received her citation and was back on the street by 6 p.m., this time with her 8-year-old son Gabe Newbrun-Mintz, who said his mother’s arrest was “sad.”\n>\n> But she stayed in the street “so that they would know she was serious about the civil rights,” he said.\n\nNone of this is necessarily bad, though it is a little \u003Cem>weird\u003C/em> when you pause to think about it.\n(No weirder than sackcloth & ashes or self-flagellation, though, I suppose.)\nMaybe I’m reading too much in to this, but I’m struck by the phrase “Mintz received her citation” in the above excerpt.\nIt’s a description that would apply equally well to a summons to appear in court and to an official commendation of praiseworthy action.\n\nWhile this sort of thing may seem harmless, I worry that people confuse this theatrical arrest-as-protest sort of thing with genuine civil disobedience.\nIf so, they may forget the practical power that well-crafted civil disobedience campaigns and actions have.\n\n## How Fetishizing Arrest Can Make You Neglect Worthy Goals\n\nI’ve also seen activists lose sight of important goals and practical means of achieving them because they pursue opportunities to be arrested instead.\n\nFor example, I attended the strategy meetings of a group that planned an action to disrupt the San Francisco headquarters of the military contractor Bechtel in 2006.\nWhen the group discussed what sort of action to do, the questions of “do we want to do an action where people risk arrest?” and “who here is planning to risk arrest?” came up before any discussion about what goals the activists hoped to accomplish with their action (unless, that is, being arrested \u003Cem>was\u003C/em> their goal).\n\nEventually I asked “what is the goal of the civil disobedience action—to get arrested, or to inconvenience Bechtel, or to get press coverage, or what?”\nThe consensus seemed to be that inconveniencing Bechtel—or “shutting down” Bechtel if you allow for hyperbole—was the goal.\n\nBut later, two women at the same meeting said that they once had tried on their own to deliver a message to Bechtel’s CEO.\nBechtel’s security, realizing that some sort of protest was happening, started their standard procedure for such things—which was to shut down the building and let nobody in or out (even employees).\nTwo people, not intending to be arrested, managed to shut down the Bechtel home office for 45 minutes one day just by showing up and asking to speak with the boss.\n\nBut because the activists at the meeting were more intent on getting arrested than on the ostensible purpose of their action (to “shut down Bechtel”), they did not attend to this information but instead they planned an action in which they would lock arms and conduct a sit-down blockade of the building’s doors until the police hauled them away.\n\nAs it turns out, this blockade would prove ineffective at either shutting down the building or preventing the people who worked there from coming and going (indeed, the police didn’t even find it necessary to arrest any of the door-blockers).\nHowever, when one of the activists walked into the lobby, towards the tail-end of the action, and began protesting there (though this was not part of the previously-agreed-upon game plan), the building’s security \u003Cem>did\u003C/em> shut the building down—until they managed to have the protester hauled away.\n\nI bring this up to encourage you to evaluate the techniques you read about in this book primarily on how \u003Cem>effective\u003C/em> they might be in meeting the true goals of your campaign—not on how hard-core they appear, how much disregard they show for the law, or how much risk they involve for their practitioners.\nNone of those things are dependable proxies for effectiveness.\n\nThe following chapters look back over many tax resistance campaigns that have been conducted through the centuries around the world, examining the tactics they employed.\nI briefly introduce each tactic, and then usually let the examples do the talking.\nBut as your author slips into the past tense, I hope you will keep at least one eye on the future.\nLook at these examples and decide which lessons from them you can apply to your campaign tomorrow.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Coté, J., May, M., Stannard, M.B., and Fagan, K. “Same-sex marriage protestors stop

be successful if it grows beyond simply advocating and practicing some form of tax resistance.\nThat is only one of the fronts on which a tax resistance struggle takes place.\nA successful campaign will also address each of these:\n\n**Support Tax Resisters**\n: If tax resistance were easy, everybody would do it.\n  A government doesn’t govern for long unless it can make life difficult for people who refuse to cough up the demanded tribute.\n\n: For this reason, enthusiasm and righteous anger are usually not enough to keep a tax resistance campaign going.\n  A successful campaign provides practical and moral support to resisters so that they’ll keep resisting when things get tough.\n\n**Increase the Number of Resisters**\n: In general, the more people you can get to resist, the better it is for your campaign.\n  New resisters increase the impact of the resistance, give the government more headaches, and increase the credibility of your campaign’s threat to the status quo.\n\n: A successful tax resistance campaign makes it easy and attractive for people to begin resisting, and slows the rate of attrition of existing resisters.\n\n**Frustrate Government Countermeasures**\n: The government will respond to a threatening tax resistance campaign by attacking the movement itself and by taking reprisals against individual resisters.\n  There are a number of ways successful tax resistance campaigns can make it more difficult for the government to pursue such countermeasures.\n\n**Expand the Arsenal of Resistance Techniques**\n: Continually developing new tax resistance techniques has many advantages:\n  It makes your resistance more effective by increasing the amount of money withheld from the government.\n  It attracts new people to the movement by enabling people who could not resist in one way to resist in a new way.\n  And, by introducing new resistance techniques faster than the government can discourage the old ones, it makes the government play a frustrating game of “whack-a-mole.”\n\n**Education and Public Relations**\n: By taking charge of your campaign’s image and message, you help it be more persuasive to the population as a whole or to people in positions of influence.\n  You also can educate people about the techniques and consequences of resistance, which helps in your recruitment efforts.\n\n**Lay the Groundwork for Victory**\n: As you develop your campaign, consider what victory will look like and how you’ll preserve it once you’ve won it.\n  A successful tax resistance campaign doesn’t necessarily end with a showy flag-raising—it’s often more subtle than that.\n\nIn the following chapters, I’ll show you examples of tactics that have been used by tax resistance campaigns from around the world and throughout history to expand their struggles on each of these fronts.\nIn a final chapter, I’ll also discuss how solitary tax resisters can also be successful on their own terms.\n\nBut first I’d like to consider some more general concerns about activism and dissent.","src/content/docs/multiplefronts/introduction.mdx","ce4ad40882726944","multiplefronts/petulantprotest",{"id":383,"data":385,"body":391,"filePath":392,"digest":393,"deferredRender":16},{"title":386,"description":387,"editUrl":16,"head":388,"template":52,"sidebar":389,"pagefind":16,"draft":39},"Petulant Protest","When you choose your tactics, beware of the temptation to “petulant” protest.",[],{"order":102,"hidden":39,"attrs":390},{},"When you choose your tactics, beware of the temptation to “petulant” protest.\n\nPetulance paints the relationship between the protester and the target of the protest as like that of an unruly child to a parent.\nPetulant tactics can take the form of making “demands” with nothing much to back them up but the demand itself.\nOr they can be protest methods that seem borrowed from a two-year-old—grown-up versions of “I’ll hold my breath until I die if you don’t give me what I want” or “I’m going to stomp my feet and scream if I don’t get my way.”\n\nBecause they take the form of a tantrum, petulant protests increase bystander sympathy for the parentish figure and reduce sympathy for the childish figure.\nSuch protests also reinforce the idea that the parentish figure ought naturally to be making the decisions.\nIn other words, petulant tactics \u003Cem>bolster\u003C/em> the authority of the target of the protest.\n\nWise parents do not give in to temper tantrums, and similarly, targets of petulant protests appear wise and sympathetic when they do not give in or when they defuse such a protest by conciliating in token and condescending ways.\nThis makes it less likely that the goals of the protesters will be met (if those goals depend on changing the behavior of the protest target).\n\nA petulant protest is not an act of assertiveness, but a symptom of submissiveness.\nPetulant tactics reinforce protesters’ feelings of inferiority and powerlessness, and thereby discourage them from taking the necessary bold, confident, and effective steps to create change.\nInferior and powerless people whine, make toothless demands, and throw tantrums.\nEqual and confident people look each other in the eye, state their cases calmly and forthrightly, and do what they feel they have to do.\nPetulant protesters, by reinforcing the feelings of social superiority in their targets, can make those targets less inclined to negotiate or to listen.\n\nDefenders of petulant protest tactics might argue that such tactics are best because their targets are not like \u003Cem>wise\u003C/em> parents at all, but like foolish ones, and in such cases petulance has a good chance of working.\nAlso, some protesters are forced into positions of powerless inferiority and then have no recourse but to use petulant tactics that are appropriate to such a position—for instance, the [Irish prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Irish_hunger_strike) who used tactics like hunger strikes or smearing the walls of their cells with feces.\nThere is little dignity in shit-smearing, but a prisoner has fewer options for dignified resistance and so may reasonably decide to choose from other tactics.\n\nBut even if there may be situations in which petulant tactics are called for, I often see such tactics used at times and in ways that seem counterproductive.\nSwitching to tactics that are dignified and that assert the social and ethical equality of the protesters and the protest target might be more effective—both at winning the immediate goals of the protesters and (what ought to be among the long-term goals of anyone working for a better world) at encouraging more healthy relationships among people and between people and institutions.\n\nFor example, [the lunch counter sit-ins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-in_movement) during the American civil rights movement were done in a dignified way:\npolite, well-disciplined black Americans sat at “whites-only” lunch counters, and stayed there in patient expectation of being treated in a reciprocally dignified manner although they were refused service.\nIf they had chosen a petulant mode of protest, they might have then begun chanting (“whose counter? \u003Cem>our\u003C/em> counter!”), or abusing the staff, or maybe vandalizing the lunch counters.\nInstead, they stuck with the quiet dignity approach, and let the white racists monopolize the petulant tactics (violence, verbal abuse, spitting on or pouring catsup over the protesters, and other things of that nature).\nThe dignified approach arguably was more effective at ending lunch counter segregation (the immediate goal of the protests), but was \u003Cem>certainly\u003C/em> more effective at discrediting racism and Jim Crow and at increasing sympathy with the civil rights movement.\n\nThis example is more cut-and-dried than most, since the battle against Jim Crow was so centered on asserting dignity and equality—but I think most other individual and grassroots political actions would also benefit from transcending the petulant and taking a forthright, dignified, confident posture.\n\nHow do we defend ourselves against the temptation to petulance at times when it is unnecessary and counter-productive?\n\nFirst, acknowledge that the temptation exists, and that it springs from protesters’ feelings of inferiority with respect to the protest target.\nProtesters act petulantly for much the same reason a child does—because we despair of being listened to or heeded any other way and we are too powerless, inarticulate, or uncreative to use more effective methods of meeting our goals.\n\nSecond, examine protest tactics to discern to what extent they use petulance.\nShare your observations with others, compare notes.\nEvaluate protests not only in terms of the immediate goals they meet, but also what impressions they create or reinforce about the relationship between the protesters, the protest targets, and bystanders.\n\nThird, reimagine your relationship with the targets of your protests in such a way as to suspend or dispel any feeling of inferiority.\nIf you felt yourself to be the social and ethical equal of the people who are the target of your protest (as you perhaps already consider yourself to be, on a rational level), how would you convey your protest to them and how would you expect them to respond?\n\nFourth, know that petulance is usually meant to intensify or amplify a protest that feels too small, unnoticed, or insufficient.\nWhen you feel the petulant temptation, see if you can amplify your protest in some other fashion.\nIf not, consider that maybe a quiet, dignified, under-the-radar protest might nonetheless be more effective in the long run than a loud, annoying, attention-getting, petulant one.\n\nFifth, be honest with yourself and others about what you are doing and what goals you can reasonably expect to accomplish.\nPetulant protest is often accompanied by bluster and exaggeration, which can damage your credibility and also can lead to discouragement when reality contradicts you.\n\nBy taking care in this way, you can increase the effectiveness of your actions, reduce the risk of burnout, become more appealing and convincing to potential sympathizers, and contribute to a better world in the long run.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Gandhi counseled:\n  > Non-cooperation is not a movement of brag, bluster, or bluff. It is a test of our sincerity. It requires solid and silent self-sacrifice. It challenges our honesty and our capacity for national work. It is a movement that aims at translating ideas into action…\n  >\n  > A non-cooperationist strives to compel attention and to set an example not by his violence but by his unobtrusive humility. He allows his solid action to speak for his creed. His strength lies in his reliance upon the correctness of his position. And the conviction of it grows most in his opponent when he least interposes his speech between his action and his opponent. Speech, especially when it is haughty, betrays want of confidence and it makes one’s opponent sceptical about the reality of the act itself.\n\n  ― \u003Ci>Young India\u003C/i> Vol. I; pp. 65–66\n\n  When I originally wrote up these observations, I used Gandhi’s hunger strikes as an example of a variety of petulant protest that may have been an effective one.\n  After reviewing some of what Gandhi wrote about the tactic, though, I’m not sure it qualifies.\n  When he was on hunger strikes, he often compared \u003Cem>himself\u003C/em> to a parent, and those he was trying to influence to children.\n  He viewed hunger strikes (sometimes, anyway) as a form of penance he would undertake because he had failed to discipline his (metaphorical) children well; the “children” would then, because of their esteem for him, repent and get straight (at least if the strike worked as planned).\n  This is a little odd, and bears some resemblance to the petulant mode I’m trying to describe, but isn’t quite the same.\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/docs/multiplefronts/petulantprotest.mdx","d9bb3a0d51a8a810","multiplefronts/violenceandnonviolence",{"id":394,"data":396,"body":402,"filePath":403,"digest":404,"deferredRender":16},{"title":397,"description":398,"editUrl":16,"head":399,"template":52,"sidebar":400,"pagefind":16,"draft":39},"On Violence and Nonviolence","Some tax resistance campaigns are nonviolent, some are not.",[],{"order":54,"hidden":39,"attrs":401},{},"Tax resistance is a technique studied by scholars of nonviolent conflict.\nThis field of study has attracted a lot of attention in recent years, particularly because of the success of “people power” uprisings that used varieties of nonviolent resistance tactics and that explicitly disavowed violence.\n\nBut of the tax resistance campaigns I studied, only some made an effort to maintain nonviolence.\nMany others were willing and able to augment their tax resistance with violent tactics.\nOthers were incidentally nonviolent without having made any special commitment to be so.\nThis book covers both violent and nonviolent tactics (as well as some tactics, like property destruction or sabotage, that some people consider to be violent and others do not).\n\nViolence certainly can be an effective way to disrupt the tax collecting bureaucracy.\nMost tax collectors are not particularly enthusiastic about their calling to begin with, and so a little violent intimidation can go a long way in discouraging them.\nThis makes tax collection more expensive for the government, decreasing its return-on-investment and compelling the government either to tighten its belt or to resort to higher taxes and thereby encourage more people to resist.\n\nBut violence also may backfire.\nSome of the tax resistance campaigns I studied showed great success right up to the point where they started deploying violent tactics, whereupon they lost popular support, became subject to easier-to-justify draconian crack-downs, or reinvigorated their opponents.\nViolence also harms the body politic (and so also the resisters who make up part of it) by increasing fear, divisiveness, and tension, by giving precedent to people who use violence to try to resolve their conflicts, by making it harder for opposing sides to come to a reconciliation, and so forth.\nAnd of course, in many cases, it is just cruel and wrong.\n\nBut it’s also worth remembering that some injustice—particularly government-sanctioned injustice—masquerades as nonviolence while really having a violent nature.\nSo long as the veiled threat of violence is enough to subdue challenges, what looks like “peace” prevails and superficially nonviolent behavior contains hidden violence.\n\nFor the most part, in this book I present examples of violent tactics without passing judgement on whether or not I think they were justified.\nSome examples of tax resistance campaigns, for example the Rebecca Riots in Wales, are hard to imagine without violence.\nOthers, like the Regulator movement in colonial North Carolina, seem to me to be cases where violent tactics were counterproductive to the point of being disastrous.\nThe Whiskey Tax Rebellion in the early United States is an interesting example of this:\nIn Pennsylvania, rebels turned to violent tactics, and were violently repressed by the federal army.\nIn Kentucky, on the other hand, the tax refusers stuck with a variety of nonviolent tactics and continued successfully evading the tax for eight years, until its repeal.\n\n## Authority\n\nPolitical authority is the pinnacle of government achievement, and almost all governments strive to be seen by their subjects as having such authority—as ruling “legitimately.”\nSuch authority evolves from an origin of mixed coercion and persuasion.\nA political system of 100% persuasion is what takes place in non-governed settings:\nfor example, a group of friends deciding what sort of pizza to order will typically use persuasion, even if this results in setting up a democratic or monarchical decision-making process by temporary consensus.\n\nBut at the large-scale political level, even a 100% persuasive origin can perhaps evolve (or devolve) into an authority-based state.\nThis is the mythical origin of Hobbes’s Leviathan, of Robert Nozick’s minimal state, and various other such creatures of political philosophy.\n\nOutside of philosophy, things are typically more mixed:\nFor example, the \u003Ci>Federalist Papers\u003C/i> were a measure of persuasion that prepared Americans to be ruled by their emerging federal government, and the military repression of various unpersuaded Americans (for instance in the Whiskey Rebellion) was a measure of coercion.\nMixed together with many other ingredients, of such a recipe was the American republic made, and it is the relatively high proportion of persuasion in that mix that gives its founding such a good reputation in some quarters.\n\nOne way of looking at political authority is as a mixture of coercion and persuasion that is held in reserve:\ncapability that is potential, rather than kinetic—like a battery.\nAnother physical metaphor is to consider authority as the momentum built up through the application of coercion and persuasion, such that the momentum itself has the same sort of power that the original coercion and persuasion did.\n\nThe momentum of authority allows the government to coast:\n“We could persuade you, but you are already persuaded, remember?\nWe could compel you, but you are already compelled, remember?”\nMeanwhile its subjects feel persuaded without knowing quite which arguments persuaded them, and feel compelled without ever feeling the grip on their shoulders or the bayonet at their backs.\n\nIf a government’s authority is challenged, it will temporarily retrench into a position from which it can unleash its potential political capability as kinetic political capability and thereby remove the challenge.\nIt will use the tools of coercion and persuasion that it has kept in reserve.\n\nIn this way, nonviolent resistance can make visible the hidden violence of authoritarian coercion.\nBy challenging the authority of the government, you call its bluff and force it to reveal its hand.\nIf it has a strong persuasive hand, well, there you go, and maybe you’re even persuaded.\nIf it has a strong coercive hand, suddenly people begin to feel its tight grip on their shoulders.\nIf neither hand is strong, suddenly this too is exposed, and the power-behind-the-throne is revealed to be not so powerful after all.\n\nFor this reason it may be important and useful for you to force the government to retrench from authority to its more concrete basis in coercion and persuasion, even if you do not have the power to overcome it once it has retrenched.\n\nThe danger is that if you challenge the government to drop its mask of authority and show you the fangs of coercion that lie behind it, you might very well get bit.\nAnd the stronger and more effective your challenge to authority is, the more vicious will be the government’s reaction.\n\nThe more benign the government you challenge, the more it will try to retreat into a stance dominated by persuasion over coercion.\nThe more malign it is, the more eagerly it will bring out the hardware.\nBut the paradox is that the longer you wait and the more malevolent the government becomes, the more dangerous it is to challenge it, while at the same time such a challenge is more imperative.\n\nThe way out of this dilemma is to be quicker to challenge political authority (and this means saying “no” to its commands, not merely grumbling “I disapprove” to its heralds)—and to make this challenge at the first sign that authority is misused, rather than waiting until it has become so tyrannical that it knows no limits.\n\n## Ineffectiveness Is Not a Nonviolent Tactic\n\nSome people think nonviolence is perversely self-sabotaging—like fighting with one hand tied behind your back.\nIf you were really serious about winning, they believe, you wouldn’t surrender the violent tools in your toolkit before the struggle even begins.\n\nI think this argument arises not because nonviolent action is inherently flawed, but because many activists have used “nonviolence” as their excuse for choosing ineffective tactics that don’t involve much risk (particularly the risk of success).\n\nIn reaction to this are violent, “black bloc”-style protesters and anti-nonviolence theoreticians like Derrick Jensen and Ward Churchill.\nThey see nonviolent protest as pathetic and timid pleading to an unresponsive and hostile government—symbolic rather than direct, predictable (and predictably ineffective), self-aggrandizing, hobbyish, and effectively collaborationist with political authority and therefore violent by proxy—ultimately, no better than the electoral process at generating real change.\nAnd they’re not willing to go along with the well-worn techniques of losing.\n\nFor a movement dedicated to nonviolence to withstand such challenges, it must not mistake a non-confrontational action for a non-violent one, or confuse making an “incredibly powerful statement” with making progress.\n\nPeople who are committed to nonviolence and who want to discourage violence in their campaigns should ask how Gandhi prevented the Indian National Congress from choosing the tactics of those in India who were advocating armed insurrection.\nThe answer: he was more hard-core than they were, and he demonstrated results.\n\n## Satyagraha\n\nDeliberate, principled, Gandhi-style nonviolence not only can be an effective technique of political force, but it includes safeguards that make it difficult to use in the service of injustice.\nA Gandhian revolution seems better-protected from devolving, as so many other revolutions have, into one in which the revolutionaries become the oppressors.\n\n![Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohandas Gandhi, seated side by side, looking at each other and smiling in a casual moment](../../../assets/gandhi-nehru.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru confer at the 1937 Indian National Congress\u003C/figcaption>\n\nGandhi initially used the English term “passive resistance” to describe his techniques.\nBut that phrase led to confusion.\nGandhi was once introduced to an English-speaking audience by a friend who inadvertently insulted Gandhi’s work in South Africa—saying that Gandhi’s forces “are weak and have no arms.\nTherefore they have taken to passive resistance which is the weapon of the weak.”\n\nGandhi decided that “passive resistance” was an inappropriate description:\n“it was supposed to be a weapon of the weak… could be characterized by hatred, and… could finally manifest itself as violence.”\nHe decided to use the term \u003Ci>satyagraha\u003C/i> (roughly-translated: “truth-force”) instead, and he took pains to emphasize that it was a powerful tool for the strong, not a second-best tactic of the weak.\n\nSatyagraha includes a more radical limitation than the renunciation of violence.\nIn its purest forms it also includes the renunciation of \u003Cem>force\u003C/em>—except perhaps persuasive moral force.\nAnd it sets much loftier political goals than run-of-the-mill nonviolent action.\nIt does not claim victory in the defeat or subjugation of its foes.\nInstead, victory comes when those foes, under no threat aside from that of their own awakened consciences, willingly and gladly change their behavior and rejoin the satyagrahi in a cooperative community.\n\nThis restricts your choice of tactics much more than a commitment to “nonviolence” does.\nWould Gandhi have signed off on [the lunch counter sit-ins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-in_movement) of the American civil rights movement?\nIt is possible that he would have considered them to be too coercive.\nBlockades and sit-ins designed to prevent people from doing business or moving about could be considered violations of satyagraha—only sit-ins like those caused when the authorities prevent people from legitimately continuing on their way are thoroughly non-forceful.\nAll lawbreaking under satyagraha is supposed to be done openly, and with the expectation and even invitation of state sanctions—would being a necessarily secret station on the [Underground Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad) have been an acceptable technique for a satyagrahi, I wonder?\n\nIn Gandhi’s view, the means so necessarily and thoroughly shape the nature of the ends that these scrupulous distinctions are important:\n“Let us first take the argument that we [in India] are justified in gaining our end by using brute force because the English gained theirs by similar means…\n[B]y using similar means we can get only the same thing that they got.\nYou will admit that we do not want that.”\nHe used this analogy:\n\n> If I want to deprive you of your watch, I shall certainly have to fight for it; if I want to buy your watch, I shall have to pay for it; and if I want a gift, I shall have to plead for it; and, according to the means I employ, the watch is stolen property, my own property, or a donation.\n\nGandhi designed satyagraha not just to be a tactic that might be useful in a particular struggle, but to be a solvent that dissolves injustice generally.\n“This force,” Gandhi wrote, “is to violence, and, therefore, to all tyranny, all injustice, what light is to darkness.”\n\nHe seemed at times to be promoting something like the “conservation of energy” principle in physics—as if there were a law of nature that if you add anger or violence to a situation, even in the service of justice, that anger and violence will reemerge as additional injustice somewhere down the line.\nOnly through satyagraha can you be certain you’re doing good, not harm.\nThe satyagrahi eagerly, even masochistically, absorbs the harm inflicted by others, without retaliation or even resentment, and thereby retires that injustice for good.\n\nViolent, coercive, or humiliating resistance tactics have certain pitfalls.\nFor instance:\n\n* They might be applied unwisely or against the wrong targets, thereby causing injustice rather than relieving it.\n* They might cause such anguish or resentment in their victims as to provoke additional injustice from them.\n* They might encourage habits of violence, coercion, or humiliation in those who use them that would lead to injustice later.\n* If they fail to achieve their intended result, they just add to the world’s suffering without anything to show for it.\n\nThe genius of satyagraha is that it is less plagued by such “collateral damage,” and it is very difficult to use in the service of an unjust cause, even by the unscrupulous or unwise.\n\nUnderstandably, Gandhi, though he considered satyagraha “so simple that it can be preached even to children,” was frequently troubled by campaigns that went awry due to his followers’ imprecise understanding of (or uncertain faith in) the technique.\nHe had to pay a lot of attention to education and discipline, especially as his mass campaigns in India developed.\nThe full satyagraha vows were almost monastic in tone.\n\nBut Gandhi was confident enough in his methods that he led campaigns of resisters whose understanding was weak and whose training was incomplete.\nHe did not feel the need to wait until his ideal was fully realized before acting, but hoped instead to realize his ideal in part through action and experimentation.\nIt would be a shame if the lesson people took from Gandhi was that they should become saints first, and do good afterwards.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Mary K. Bonsteel Tachau “The Whiskey Rebellion in Kentucky: A Forgotten Episode of Civil Disobedience” \u003Ci>Journal of the Early Republic\u003C/i> (1982), pp. 239–259\n* Hannah Arendt, in \u003Ci>Between Past and Future\u003C/i>, described political “authority” this way:\n  > Since authority always demands obedience, it is commonly taken for some form of power or violence. Yet authority precludes the use of external means of coercion; where force is used, authority itself has failed. Authority, on the other hand, is incompatible with persuasion, which presupposes equality and works through a process of argumentation. Where arguments are used, authority is left in abeyance. Against the egalitarian order of persuasion stands the authoritarian order, which is always hierarchical. If authority is to be defined at all, then, it must be in contradistinction to both coercion by force and persuasion through arguments.\n* I base my guesses about how Gandhi would apply his theories to the American civil rights campaign on how Gandhi advised the satyagrahis engaged in a campaign against the policy of excluding “untouchables” from the Vykom temple. One wrote to him asking whether they should consider blockading the temple and preventing orthodox Hindus from entering until they allowed “untouchables” to worship there. Gandhi responded, in part:\n  > Such blocking the way will be sheer compulsion… [The word] Satyagraha is often most loosely used and is made to cover veiled violence. But as the author of the word I may be allowed to say that it excludes every form of violence, direct or indirect, veiled or unveiled, and whether in thought, word or deed… Satyagraha is gentle, it never wounds. It must not be the result of anger or malice. It is never fussy, never impatient, never vociferous. It is the direct opposite of compulsion. It was conceived as a complete substitute for violence.\n\n  On the other hand, Gandhi endorsed sit-ins at the blockades where police were preventing “untouchables” and their supporters from approaching the temple—these sit-ins were not coercive, but were reactions to the illegitimate coercion of the police.

be to join or support a resistance campaign, and can also more-confidently reassure potential resisters that they will not be alone.\nSome movements have also found that conducting surveys allows for outreach that has a value beyond that of collecting information.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Dublin Water Charge Strike\n\nOpponents of a new water charge in Dublin were told by the government that they were a radical fringe of unrepresentative malcontents and that most citizens supported the new tax.\nThe Secretary of the Federation of Dublin Anti Water Charge Campaigns remembers:\n\n> Our immediate response was to challenge his contention and to propose a survey of the area to find out what people really thought, and a further public meeting to report the findings.\n> Within 15 minutes we had a dozen volunteers to carry out the survey and these went on to form the nucleus of what became one of the most active campaign groups in the federation.\n> The follow-up meeting 3 weeks later heard that something like 85% of the local residents opposed the tax.\n> The fact of carrying out this survey gave everybody the confidence that the silent majority were with us, and for those who carried out the survey, they realised that it wasn’t such a difficult thing to knock on their neighbours’ doors and talk to them and it gave them the confidence to go on to become key campaign activists.\n>\n> It’s something I would recommend that campaigners try—doing a survey such as this or even collecting a petition in an area, knocking on doors and talking to people about the issue gives those people who we are hoping will become campaign activists a sense of ownership of the local campaign as well as demonstrating quite clearly the strength of feeling on the issue.\n> People need to feel that it’s their campaign—not one either owned by or controlled by any political organisation or party.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nIn the anti-poll tax movement in Thatcher’s Britain, a Bristol organizer remembers that his neighborhood group “was strengthened by a door-to-door survey of over 500 households”:\n\n> The survey was not intended to be scientifically accurate.\n> Its purpose was to give the APTU [anti-poll tax union] a fairly accurate picture of what was happening on the ground, and, perhaps more significantly, it was a pretext for engaging people in conversation about the Poll Tax, informing them of the non-payment campaign and encouraging them to join their local APTU.\n> The results were interesting.\n> Only 20% said that they would definitely pay.\n> The same number said that they would definitely not, but more significantly, 55% said that they wouldn’t pay if a lot of other people in the area weren’t paying either.\n> So even at this early stage we knew that non-payment was going to be massive.\n> Over a third of the people canvassed became paid up members of the union.\n> By the end of the exercise Easton had over 300 members and street reps for almost every street.\n>\n> The canvass was not left there.\n> The key to its success was the second visit.\n> The group compiled all the statistics on a street by street basis and many of the reps then went back, door-to-door, and told people the results of the survey in their street and the neighbouring streets.\n> A newsletter was delivered to everyone telling them what the overall results were for Easton.\n> This meant that people knew how few of their neighbours were going to pay and it gave them confidence not to pay themselves.\n> They had spoken to the canvassers personally, so they knew that the survey was genuine.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> War Tax Resisters\n\nIn 2006 the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee surveyed tax resisters, former resisters, and anti-war activists who had never resisted taxes, to find out how they felt about war tax resistance.\nThey used some of the information—for instance a question posed to the never-resisters about their reasons for not resisting—to help them refine their outreach message.\nAlmost two-thirds of those activists answered “yes” to the question:\n\n> Would you consider participating in a \u003Cem>one-year commitment\u003C/em> to refuse a portion of your federal income taxes and redirect your taxes to a humanitarian cause if thousands joined you publicly?\n\nThis encouraging response led the group to launch what it called the “2008 War Tax Boycott.”\nAlthough the Boycott itself did not generate the hoped-for “thousands,” the group found it to be a useful outreach platform, and continued to use it in subsequent years.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and

resistance in Australia’s Northern Territory in 1919.\nHe warned the government against trying to crack down on the resisters:\n“He did not want trouble… but unless the Government adopted different methods they would spread the seeds of Bolshevism faster than by any other method.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Women’s Suffrage\n\nThe Women’s Tax Resistance League in the U.K. won a lot more sympathy than they might have otherwise because they could contrast their nonviolent “passive resistance” tactics with those of the “militant” wing of the women’s suffrage movement, whose members used arson, assault, and other violent tactics.\nMary Russell, when she began resisting her property tax, said:\n\n> I am very strongly opposed to the militant tactics adopted by a portion of those who are in favour of women’s franchise, and I have therefore taken this, the only course open to me, which appears justifiable, of protesting against the way in which the question of woman suffrage has been treated by the Government.\n\nIn the United States, the women’s suffrage movement was considerably more restrained.\nThere was no significant “militant” wing to act as the bad cop to the tax resisters’ good cop.\nThis may have contributed to the slower adoption of tax resistance there.\nOne American suffragist, commenting on Mary Russell’s resistance, noted that “this was [her] manner of protesting against militancy, though I fancy we should have considered it rather militant here.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and

that makes them out to be anti-social misers is by paying their taxes into escrow accounts.\n\nWhen resisters use this tactic, instead of paying taxes to the government, they deposit the money into a special account and say they’re willing to relinquish it to the government at a future date \u003Cem>if\u003C/em> the government meets certain conditions.\nThe message conveyed by this is that “we will pay our share of money for the government’s upkeep—we’re not just keeping the money for ourselves—but we’re not going to let the government have the money until it shapes up.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Examples\" size=\"medium\" /> Quakers\n\nThe Purchase Quarterly Meeting of Quakers set up something it called the “Peace Tax Escrow Account” into which war tax resisters could deposit their refused taxes.\nThe Meeting said it would turn this account over to the government if the government were to give taxpayers a way to pay such taxes without paying for the military functions of government.\n\nThe Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Quakers lost a court battle in which the IRS hoped to force them to withhold taxes from a war tax resisting employee.\nThe Meeting then began withholding the taxes as ordered, but rather than submitting the money to the IRS, the Meeting put it into an escrow account and told the agency it would have to seize the money.\nThe London Yearly Meeting also put resisted taxes from 25 war tax resisting employees of the Friends House in an escrow account—“the intention being to release it to Inland Revenue after assurances that it would be used for non-military purposes.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Tijuana Chamber of Commerce\n\nIn 2006, the Chamber of Commerce in Tijuana, Mexico led a business tax strike to

the government from classifying the member businesses as tax delinquents.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Markus Zwicklbauer\n\nThis tactic can be used by individuals as well as groups.\nFor example, in 2011 Markus Zwicklbauer, a 58-year-old tax consultant from Fürstenzell, Germany, began paying his taxes into an escrow account which he says he will release to the government

and pundits and other such clergy—to convince their subjects that paying taxes is not only mandatory, but that it’s honorable, dignified, and even charitable, while failure to pay taxes is underhanded, shady, and selfish.\n\nGovernments and other critics of tax resistance are quick to deploy this already-available propaganda lexicon in their counterattacks.\nThey criticize tax resisters as freeloaders who enjoy the benefits of organized society without cooperating in the taxes necessary to fund them—as self-interested, anti-social tax evaders.\n\nOne way resisters counter this attack is by staging giveaways of their resisted taxes.\nThis makes it clear that the resisters do not have merely selfish motives for resisting, and also demonstrates that the money is being spent for the benefit of society (and to a greater extent than if the money had been filtered through the government first).\n\nThis sort of tax redirection also can forge or strengthen ties between the resisters and the recipients, and can make more people aware of tax resistance as an option.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Examples\" size=\"medium\" /> War Tax Resisters\n\nThis tactic is put to particularly good use by the contemporary war tax resistance movement.\nHere are some examples:\n\nWhen Julia “Butterfly” Hill refused to pay more than $150,000 in taxes to the U.S. government in 2003, she made a point of saying “I ‘redirect’ my taxes rather than ‘resisting’ my taxes”:\n\n> I actually take the money that the IRS says goes to them and I give it to the places where our taxes should be going.\n> And in my letter to the IRS I said: “I’m not refusing to pay my taxes.\n> I’m actually paying them but I’m paying them where they belong because you refuse to do so.”\n> They are not directing our money where it should be going, they are being horrific stewards of that money.\n\nNWTRCC organized what it called a “War Tax Boycott” in 2008.\nIt encouraged war tax resisters across the country to coordinate by redirecting their refused taxes to either of two groups:\none that provided healthcare in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and one that helped Iraq War refugees.\nThe campaign kept track of how much money had been redirected over the course of the boycott, and then held a press conference to give oversized checks adding up to about $325,000 to spokespeople for these campaigns.\n\nThe People’s Life Fund is associated with the group Northern California War Tax Resistance, and holds redirected taxes from resisters.\nIf the IRS successfully seizes money from a resister, that resister can reclaim his or her deposits to the Fund.\nOtherwise, the money remains there and earns interest and dividends.\nEvery year the group pools these returns on investment and gives them away to local charitable organizations in a granting ceremony.\nUsually these grants are modest—$500 or $1,000 each—but they give them to a dozen or more groups, which makes their granting ceremonies a good way for local charities to network with each other and helps spread the word about war tax resistance in the local activist community.\n\nThis same model, or one similar to it, is followed by a number of regional redirection funds associated with war tax resistance groups in the United States.\nA war tax resistance group in Iowa used the proceeds from its redirection fund to create a scholarship for college students who had been banned from applying for government financial aid because of their refusal to register for the draft.\nAnother, in Pennsylvania, made an interest-free loan to a legal defense group that was supporting a group of draft resisters who were on trial.\nThese actions helped to forge or sustain ties between the war tax resistance movement and anti-conscription activists and gave war tax resistance a higher profile in the larger anti-war movement.\n\nOne family figured out a way to get extra mileage out of their redirection:\nIn 1997 they redirected their refused federal taxes to a charitable program called “Childreach.”\nThat year, the U.S. Agency for International Development, a federal government agency, had promised to match private donations to Childreach two-to-one from its budget, so the family’s $211.69 in redirected taxes had the effect of pulling an additional $423.38 from the U.S. government for a good cause.\n\n![Bill Ramsey, holding an oversized check from the “Conscience &amp; Military Tax Campaign”, stands on a street corner alongside other people holding signs and banners.](../../../assets/redirection.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>war tax resister Bill Ramsey redirects $1,000 to charity in a granting ceremony\u003C/figcaption>\n\nIn 1968, war tax resister Irving Hogan stood outside the Federal Building in San Francisco and redirected his federal income tax dollars one at a time by handing them out to passers by.\n“I want this money to be used for the delight, not the destruction, of men,” he said.\n“Here: go buy yourself a beer.”\n\nJohn and Pat Schwiebert did something similar:\nThey redirected their taxes by handing out five-dollar bills to people standing in line at the unemployment office.\nAlong with the bills, they handed out letters in which they explained their redirection action.\nTo amplify the public relations impact, they notified the media of their plans ahead of time.\n“Their actions garnered them an interview on NPR,” according to one report, “and they received letters and cards from around the world.”\n\nIn 1972 a group of war tax resisters in New York redirected their war taxes as nickels that they handed out to people waiting at the bus stops on lines where fare hikes were being proposed, saying “this is where our tax dollars should be going.”\n\nArthur Evans felt that if redirecting your war taxes to charity was a good idea, redirecting \u003Cem>twice\u003C/em> your war taxes to charity must be twice as good.\nIn 1965 he wrote to the IRS to tell them “I am sending double the amount I am not paying for war to Quaker House at the United Nations for transmission to the United Nations Organization for its technical assistance program.”\n\nIn the early 1970s, farmers who were resisting the expansion of a military base onto their land in Larzac, France, found common cause with war tax resisters.\nThousands of war tax resisters there redirected their war taxes to help fund the Larzac struggle.\n\nAnd here’s something kind of similar that doesn’t fit into any of my other categories, so I’ll toss it in here:\nWhen the IRS seized back taxes from war tax resister Mary Regan’s retirement account in 1998, she threw a fund-raising party to try to raise an equivalent amount of money—but not in order to reimburse \u003Cem>her\u003C/em>, but to give away to charities like “the Boston Women’s Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Friends Service Committee, a homeless shelter for youth, and the peace movement in Israel.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nThe Women’s Tax Resistance League largely suspended its campaign during World War I, but one woman, signing her letter “A Persistent Tax Resister” wrote to the editor of a suffragist paper to suggest that women should redirect their taxes from the government to a privately-run war relief charity “and should send her donation as ‘Taxes withheld from the Government by a voteless woman.’ ”\nSuffrage activist Charlotte Despard reported that “she had offered to give voluntarily the amount demanded of her by Revenue authorities to any war charity, but her offer had not been accepted.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Social Security Foe\n\nIn 1952, Howard Pennington, unwilling to pay an $81 social security tax “for waste by socialistic dreamers,” instead sent that money directly to George Robinett.\nRobinett was a 72-year-old retiree whose social security had been abruptly cut off for three months, costing him $210, because during one month he had earned 62 cents above the $50 maximum monthly earnings for a social security recipient.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* When I presented some of my ideas about varieties of tax resisters (see [“Varieties of Tax

size=\"medium\" /> Resonances with Earlier Tax Rebellions\n\nAlmost every tax revolt in the U.S. appropriates the Boston Tea Party as an evocative example of a righteous grassroots uprising.\nThe “Taxed Enough Already” TEA Party protests beginning in 2009 were just one of many, many examples.\n\nIn Spain, the \u003Ci>Tancament de Caixes\u003C/i> (“shutting the cashboxes”) campaign in 1899 plays a similar role: modern Spanish tax resisters take inspiration from and compare their campaigns with that legendary struggle.\n\nIn Brittany, during the \u003Ci>bonnets rouges\u003C/i> tax riots there in late 2013, “protesters wore red caps as a symbol of the Bretons’ historical resistance to taxes imposed by the ‘Sun King,’ Louis XIV.”\n\nIn England (and the British empire), the 1635 refusal by John Hampden to pay the King’s “ship money” has long been the example of choice—he has been trotted out from South Africa to Ireland to India to prove that celebrated patriots can refuse to pay tribute to the crown.\n\nThe phrase “no taxation without representation” has rhetorical power, especially in the nations descended from the British Empire.\nIt was especially potent in the American revolution and in the women’s suffrage movements.\nIt is sometimes used today even in support of tax resistance campaigns in which \u003Cem>representation\u003C/em> isn’t really an issue, as people have come to use the aphorism more as an incantation than a statement of principle.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca Rioters in Wales, who painted their faces and dressed in drag to destroy tollgates in the middle of the nineteenth century, were tapping into a folkloric form of grassroots vigilantism that was centuries old.\n“Jack a Lents” painted their faces and dressed in women’s clothing to tear down turnpikes in England a century before, and I’ve found references to protesters led by men in women’s clothing who used the shared pseudonym of “Lady Skimmington” in the Western Rising in England a century before that.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Robin Hood\n\nThe Robin Hood myth has taken on a tax resistance theme in recent years.\nThe Disney animated version of the Robin Hood story makes the wicked Sheriff of Nottingham a tax collector.\nRobin Hood robs him in order to redistribute the taxes

Scott wrote:\n\n> Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the myth was its plasticity in the hands of its peasant adherents.\n> First and foremost, it was an invitation to resist any or all of the czar’s supposed agents, who could not have been carrying out the good czar’s wishes if they imposed heavy taxes, conscription, rents, military corvée, and so forth.\n> If the czar only knew of the crimes his faithless agents were committing in his name, he would punish them and rectify matters.\n> When petitions failed and oppression continued, it may simply have indicated that an impostor—a false czar—was on the throne.\n> In such cases, the peasants who joined the banners of a rebel claiming to be the true czar would be demonstrating their loyalty to the monarchy.…\n>\n> In a form of symbolic jujitsu, an apparently conservative myth counselling passivity becomes a basis for defiance and rebellion…\n\nScott also wrote about how “much of the folk culture of the peasant ‘little tradition’ amounts to a legitimation, or even a \u003Cem>celebration\u003C/em>” of resistance:\n\n> In this and other ways (e.g. tales of bandits, tricksters, peasant heroes, religious myths, carnivalesque parodies of authorities) the peasant subculture helps to underwrite dissimulation, poaching, theft, tax evasion, evasion of conscription, and so on.\n> While folk culture is not coordinational in any formal sense, it often achieves a “climate of opinion” which, in other more institutionalized societies, might require a public relations campaign.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> American Constitutionalists\n\nThe place of the benevolent, fatherly Czar in American folklore is held by the U.S. Constitution.\nMany Americans believe that this document describes or foretells a good, honest, faithful, protective, restrained government.\nIn this mythology, the reason the present government does not match this description, although it claims the Constitution as the source of its authority, is because the present government is a fraud—a sort of impostor on the throne.\n\nSometimes this mythology hearkens for a never-yet-enacted sort of Platonic constitutional order; other times it pretends to find such an order in the misty past of the real history of the United States and believes that we were somehow expelled from this political Eden but can find our way back if we keep the faith.\n\nBased on many variations of this myth, a large and enduring subculture of “constitutionalist” tax protesters developed.\nIts adherents subscribe to a baroque and ever-evolving mythology in which the entire federal income tax apparatus is operating outside of the \u003Cem>real\u003C/em> United States government.\nThey believe that you can best show your loyalty to the U.S. Constitution by treating the Internal Revenue Service as a hostile foreign cancer that impersonates healthy tissue in the body politic but has no real authority.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The Poll Tax Rebellion\n\n“Poll tax” became the most widely-accepted name for what Thatcher’s government had been hoping would go down as the benign-sounding “community charge.”\nThis naming was a potent propaganda coup for the resistance movement.\n\nDanny Burns, who chronicled that successful tax rebellion, says that “the story of [Wat Tyler’s] peasants revolt against the Poll Tax in 1381 was told in virtually every meeting.\nCalling on these traditions was an important part of explaining why non-cooperation was needed…”\n\nDuring the rebellion, people also hung signs in their windows reading “No Poll Tax Here.”\nThese signs hearkened back to similar signs from the tax resistance accompanying the Reform Act agitation in the 1830s.\n\nNow, after the success of the anti-poll tax campaign, \u003Cem>it\u003C/em> has become the example that campaigns emulate and try to live up to—for example, the Household Tax resistance campaign in Ireland.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* “Anti-layoff, tax protest in France prompts arson” \u003Ci>The Nation\u003C/i> (Thailand) 3 November 2013\n* Bowen, Ivor \u003Ci>The Statutes of Wales\u003C/i> (1908) p. cxx\n* Wright, Thomas \u003Ci>England Under the House of Hanover\u003C/i> (1848) pp. 154–55 (footnote), quoting the \u003Ci>Daily Gazetteer\u003C/i> of 8 October & 9 December 1735\n* Flaherty, W.E. \u003Ci>The annals of England\u003C/i> (1877) p. 67\n* Mercer, Johnny “The Phony King of England” Robin Hood (1973)\n* “Prometheus” commenting on 14 March 2009 at \u003Ci>The Picket Line\u003C/i>\n* Taine, Hippolyte “The Revolution” \u003Ci>We Won’t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader\u003C/i> (2008) pp. 140–53\n* Scott, James C. \u003Ci>Domination and the Arts of Resistance\u003C/i> (2008) pp. 97–98\n* Scott, James C. \u003Ci>Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance\u003C/i> (2008) p. 300\n* You can find a good look at the constitutionalist tax protester movement in the United States in Doherty, Brian “It’s So Simple, It’s Ridiculous” \u003Ci>Reason\u003C/i> May 2004\n* Burns, Danny \u003Ci>Poll Tax Rebellion\u003C/i> AK Press (1992), pp. 49, 58–59\n* “History of the Passing of the Reform Bills” in Jones, William \u003Ci>Biographical Sketches of the Reform Ministers\u003C/i> (1832) p. 780\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/docs/tacticsofeducationandpublicrelations/resonatewithlegends.mdx","8838f6b7fc634f0a","tacticsofeducationandpublicrelations/singtaxresistancesongs",{"id":470,"data":472,"body":479,"filePath":480,"digest":481,"deferredRender":16},{"title":473,"description":474,"editUrl":16,"head":475,"template":52,"sidebar":476,"pagefind":16,"draft":39},"Sing Tax Resistance Songs","Some tax resistance campaigns have had their own anthems or fight songs to help them rally the troops.",[],{"order":477,"hidden":39,"attrs":478},10,{},"import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';\nimport { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';\n\nSome tax resistance campaigns have had their own anthems or fight songs to rally the troops.\nSinging can broadcast the strength and enthusiasm of a movement and can help to build and maintain solidarity.\nSongs can also be educational tools if they have lyrics that explain how to resist or how to make resistance more successful.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nMahadev Desai, in \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i>, mentions such songs on a few occasions, and stresses their importance:\n\n> I paid a visit along with Sjt.

with a well-rehearsed pantomime to drive the point home.\n\nAt another American tax day protest, this one in St. Louis in 2003, war tax resisters at the federal building sang a protest song with lyrics like these:\n\n> For the cost of cluster bombs\u003Cbr />\n> that maim and leave to bleed\u003Cbr />\n> our kids could have more teachers\u003Cbr />\n> helping them to read.\n\nThese examples are mostly lyrics of exhortation that are designed to convince wavering taxpayers that the time is ripe to stop paying (or to remind wavering resisters why their resistance is important).\nPeople will sometimes reflect seriously on an exhortation expressed lyrically when they would dismiss it if they had to sift through a reasoned argument first.\nLyrics have a way of getting stuck in the mind,

Yourself as a Criminal for Having Paid Taxes","A counterintuitive tactic is for resisters to turn themselves in for prosecution for having paid taxes.",[],{"order":301,"hidden":39,"attrs":489},{},"import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';\n\nA counterintuitive tactic that has been used in some tax resistance campaigns is for resisters to turn themselves in for prosecution for having \u003Cem>paid\u003C/em> taxes.\n\nFor example, a group of Welsh war tax resisters went to the police in 1996 and “confessed to the crime of paying income and VAT taxes used for British nuclear programs, in violation of international law” (the police declined the invitation to arrest them).\n\nThe legal reasoning, in the abstract, is not entirely far-fetched, but it is a sort of affected naïveté to expect the government’s law enforcement apparatus to respect it.\nThis sort of tactic is a form of symbolic protest and can help to educate people about their accountability for government activities that are conducted with their acquiescence and support.\n\n## The Nuremberg Principles\n\nIs there anything to the theory that a taxpayer is legally culpable if they cooperate with the illegal acts of the government?\n\nThe Nuremberg Principles make this a plausible argument.\nThe people who drafted those Principles were trying to articulate what they supposed to be international, ever-present, and self-evident crimes.\nThis was meant to solve the problems of jurisdiction and \u003Ci>ex post facto\u003C/i> law in the trials of Nazi war criminals, and was also meant to formally outlaw such things as aggressive war.\nThe Principles state, in part:\n\n> Complicity in the commission of a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity is a crime under international law.\n\nand also:\n\n> The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.\n\nA number of war tax resisters have taken these Principles as an inspiration.\nSome have even adopted the conceit of saying they fear if they pay taxes they risk being prosecuted under the theory the Principles articulate.\n\nOne American war tax resister told me that when he refused to pay his taxes in 2003, “I also asked the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] if they could provide legal assurance that paying taxes would not leave me open to prosecution under the Nuremberg Principles.\nThe IRS replied that they could not provide a quick response to my letter since they had received ‘a large number of similar requests.’”\n\n## Conspiracy Theory\n\nA blogger once confidently told me:\n“If you pay taxes, you are as responsible for war as the soldier who kills people.\nIf you pay taxes, you are directly responsible for every bad thing government does.\nPaying taxes is immoral.”\nGandhi had a similar thought:\n\n> Most people do not understand the complicated machinery of the government.\n> They do not realize that every citizen silently but none the less certainly sustains the government of the day in ways of which he has no knowledge.\n> Every citizen therefore renders himself responsible for every act of his government.\n> And it is quite proper to support it so long as the actions of the government are bearable.\n> But when they hurt him and his nation, it becomes his duty to withdraw his support.\n\nArguments like these bear some resemblance to the legal concept of “conspiracy.”\nOne set of jury instructions about criminal conspiracy put it this way:\n\n> [W]here several persons conspire or combine together to commit any unlawful act, each is criminally responsible for the acts of his associates or confederates committed in furtherance of any prosecution of the common design for which they combine.\n> In contemplation of law, the act of one is the act of all.\n> Each is responsible for everything done by his confederates, which follows incidentally in the execution of the common design as one of its probable and natural consequences, even though it was not intended as a part of the original design or common plan.\n\nTo prove “conspiracy” in the this sense, you have to show that the conspirators agreed to work together to achieve some common end, and that either the end itself, or the methods they chose to reach that end, were illegal.\nThis isn’t as hard to prove as it might sound at first.\nYou don’t necessarily have to prove that the conspirators actually met or signed onto a formal plan.\nAs another set of jury instructions put it:\n\n> It is not necessary, to constitute a conspiracy, that two or more persons should meet together, and enter into an explicit or formal agreement for an unlawful scheme, or that they should directly by words or in writing, state what the unlawful scheme is to be, and the details of the plan or means by which the unlawful combination is to be made effective.\n> It is sufficient if two or more persons, in any manner or through any contrivance, positively or tacitly, come to a mutual understanding to accomplish a common and unlawful design.\n\nand another:\n\n> [A]ll who take part in a conspiracy after it is formed and while it is in execution, and all who, with the knowledge of the facts, concur in the facts originally formed and aid in executing them, are fellow conspirators.\n> Their concurrence, without proof of an agreement to concur, is conclusive against them.\n> They commit the offense when they become partners to the transaction or further the original plan.\n\nDo \u003Cem>taxpayers\u003C/em> meet this sort of qualification?\nIf you put on your prosecutor’s-hat, you might look at these instructions and think, “sure, I could make the charge stick.”\nBut if I’m defending a taxpayer against a charge of conspiracy, I’ve got a good trump card to play:\nIf my client is accused of conspiring with a government by paying taxes to it—how can you suggest that there was some sort of “agreement” or “mutual understanding” if the government had to threaten my client with penalties for noncompliance?\nThat doesn’t sound like an agreement to me: my client isn’t an accomplice, but a victim!\n\n## Duress—How Much Can it Excuse?\n\nBut just how good of a defense is it to say you were paying taxes under duress?\nCan such an argument always relieve you of all responsibility, or does it only work when certain conditions are met, or only relieve you of a certain amount of responsibility?\nHow much compulsion must the government use before it absorbs responsibility?\nIs there a threshold?\nDoes it depend on what they’re trying to absorb responsibility for?\n\nAfter all, it couldn’t be the case (\u003Cem>could it?\u003C/em>) that a government could “force” you to murder someone by threatening you with a small fine for refusing—and that the government could take all of the guilt off your shoulders in this way if you were to comply.\n\nAlas, when people debate the ethics of tax paying and of tax resistance, they tend to regard government compulsion as an all-or-nothing sort of thing, and so questions like these are left unaddressed.\n\nAmerican abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison said at one point that it was wrong to willingly pay taxes to a government that upholds slavery, but that to excuse yourself it is sufficient for you to announce that you are not paying willingly, and to strike an attitude in accord with that declaration:\n\n> [A person] may consent peaceably to yield up what is demanded of him, but not without remonstrance, and only as he would give up his purse to a highwayman.\n> He will not recognize it as a lawful tax—he will not pay it as a tax—but will denounce it as robbery and oppression.\n\nThe proper thing to do when the tax collector comes calling, in this school of thought, is to refuse to pay voluntarily but to submit peacefully to distraint of property.\nBut one critic argued that such passive tax resistance is really just pointless, passive-aggressive behavior (something like the “petulant mode” of protest I warned about):\n\n> It may well be questioned if the payment of rates or taxes is voluntary at all, since the account is presented in the form of a demand, and not a polite request.\n> Inasmuch as payment is compulsory in any case, is not Passive Resistance merely an awkward, expensive, and an inconvenient mode of payment for all concerned?\n\n\u003CAside type=\"tip\" title=\"See also\">\n[Petulant Protest](../../multiplefronts/petulantprotest/)\n\u003C/Aside>\n\nIt’s easy to confuse these two cases:\n\n1. Someone actually forces you to do something (such as forcing you to stay in prison by locking the doors).\n1. Someone threatens you with unpleasant consequences if you do not do something.\n\nIn the first case, you don’t have options to choose from, so you don’t have any blame for what you’re stuck with.\nIn the second, though, it is merely that the characteristics of your options have changed.\nYou still have a choice to make, and that choice can be praiseworthy or blameworthy.\n\nHannah Arendt, who studied the distressing ease with which the engineers of the Holocaust obtained the cooperation of their collaborators, warned against the idea “that to be tempted and to be forced are almost the same.”\nShe was fond of quoting Mary McCarthy on this question:\n\n> “If somebody points a gun at you and says, ‘Kill your friend or I will kill you,’ he is \u003Cem>tempting\u003C/em> you, that is all.”\n\nIf the tax collector says “give me your money or else,” that isn’t the end of the inquiry, but the time to ask “or else what?” and then to weigh the options.\nIf I believed the blogger’s argument that the tax collector was saying “be directly responsible for \u003Cem>every\u003C/em> bad thing government does or else” I’d be asking “or else \u003Cem>what?\u003C/em>” with bluff-calling incredulity.\n\n## When You Eat a Chiquita\n\nCan you be found legally guilty for payments you made under duress?\nYou certainly can, under some circumstances anyway.\nLook at what happened to Chiquita (the banana company).\n\nChiquita had been operating in Colombia and, as a cost of doing business there, had to pay taxes to some of the governments operating in that country.\nThree of those governments were designated terrorist organizations by the U.S. government, which prohibits anyone from providing funding to such organizations.\nThere is also an international agreement that prohibits funding terrorist organizations.\nIt says:\n\n> Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and wilfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out:\n>\n> (a) An act which constitutes an offence within the scope of and as defined in one of the treaties listed in the annex; or\n>\n> (b) Any other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.\n\nChiquita pled guilty in a plea bargain and was hit with a $25 million fine.\n\n## It’s Caesar’s Fault\n\nJ.G. James, the critic of “Passive Resistance” whom I quoted earlier, was an orthodox believer in law and government. \nHe felt that when taxes or tax expenditures conflicted with conscience, the proper response was to do what could be done within the law to rectify the problem, but to go no further:\n\n> [I]t is the duty of a conscientious citizen to pay an unjust charge if he has tried in vain to prevent the measure passing into law, on the ground that he is no longer responsible for the expenditure of public funds after he has done his utmost to control that expenditure by legalized means.\n\nThis argument—that once the money is out of your hands you are no longer responsible for how it is spent—comes up frequently in debates about tax resistance, often even from tax resisters themselves when they try to explain the limits of their resistance.\n\nFor instance, G.W. Gillespe was a conscientious objector during the American Civil War who refused either to enlist or to hire a substitute to serve in his place.\nBut he said he would have been willing to pay a “militia exemption tax” to get out of service if he could afford it.\nHe explained:\n\n> [T]he idea of hiring a man to kill for me would implicate me in the crime; so I refused to give even five cents for a substitute.\n>\n> If I had had three hundred dollars, I could conscientiously have given it to Caesar as a last resort, to get exempt from the bloody field of carnal strife.\n> Some tried to persuade me that it was just as bad to pay the money as to hire a substitute, as the money was for that purpose.\n> The difference is great.\n> The Lord will not hold me accountable for the mischief that money, taken from me by force, would do when employed by others.\n> Caesar demands taxes of us; we pay them, according to the instruction and example of our Lord.\n> We render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s, and Caesar hires a man to shoot his enemies for him; are we to blame?\n> By no means.\n> But to hire a man to fight in my place would be like hiring a thief to steal in my place: Both guilty.\n\n## Rendering unto Caesar\n\nHere we hit one of the big stumbling blocks that Christian tax resisters have run into.\nThe New Testament is distressingly explicit, in \u003Ci>Romans\u003C/i> 13:\n\n> Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.\n> The authorities that exist have been established by God.\n> Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.…\n> [I]t is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience.\n> This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing.\n> Give everyone what you owe him:\n> If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.\n\nIf Jesus wanted us to know that we should resist taxes to governments that would apply the tax money in sinful ways, he was given every opportunity to make this clear when he was asked:\n“Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”\nInstead, he responded with “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s,” which successfully bewildered everybody at the time, and the meaning of which continues to defy consensus today.\n\nThe best that Christian tax resisters could come up with, Biblically, to justify their position was either a confidently asserted (if somewhat strained) reading of the “Give to Caesar” koan, or the story from \u003Ci>Acts\u003C/i> 5 in which the apostles defied the law and continued to preach the gospel according to God’s explicit command.\nAsked to explain themselves on that occasion,\n\n> Peter and the other apostles replied: “We must obey God rather than men!”\n\nMost Christian tax resisters took the “Give to Caesar” passage and certainly the one in Romans to mean that God does indeed command us to pay taxes, even to unjust governments.\nBut they interpreted the Acts “obey God rather than men” statement as providing an occasional override—essentially: “render unto Caesar and submit to the government, unless that would mean disobeying God.”\n\nAmerican Christian pacifist T.S. Grimké put it this way:\n\n> [If the ruler] require me to pay taxes, although one object of the taxes be the support of idolatry, or the waging of war, I comply, simply because he has a clear right to levy taxes, and the responsibility of applying them is with him, not with me…\n>\n> If he commands what is unlawful, as a means for the attainment of even a lawful end, I refuse obedience.\n> But if he commands what is lawful, intending when the command has been performed by me, to employ the fruit of my obedience in the accomplishment of unlawful purposes in which I have no hand, I obey, because he requires of me only what is rightful.\n> I have nothing to do with his motive or his object.\n>\n> I would illustrate this by the case of a debt.\n> I am indebted to another.\n> He demands payment.\n> I am not at liberty to refuse, because I happen to know, or have reason to believe that he will employ the money, when paid, for unlawful or immoral purposes.\n> This follows from the principle already stated.\n> My duty is very clear, to pay the debt: the use of the money, when paid, is at once his right and responsibility…\n>\n> [However, if the] magistrate, instead of a general tax law divides the taxes, and lays on the advocates of Peace the war tax.\n> They cannot conscientiously pay it; because they are thus made the sole and direct instrument of carrying on the war, and without their compliance, it must be at a stand.\n\n## Is Paying a Tax Really Like Paying a Debt?\n\nThe comparison of taxes to debts has been an important metaphor in debates about the ethics of tax resistance.\n\nIf paying taxes to the government is good in and of itself (for instance, because God has so decreed it) then taxpaying can’t simply be judged according to its consequences.\nA tax payment, in this way of thinking, is not a donation or a subscription or a contribution that is made voluntarily with an aim to supporting whatever cause the funds are being raised for, but is a duty akin to paying a debt.\nYou can’t ethically refuse to repay a loan because you think the person you owe money to will spend the money unwisely.\n\nHere’s an example of how this metaphor was used to justify the nuanced position of one tax resister:\nJoshua Maule was a Quaker advocate of war tax resistance.\nWhen the government increased a general tax by a certain percentage in order to pay for war expenses (and they explicitly said this was the reason), Maule refused to pay this additional fraction of his taxes, and he insisted that this was the only position consistent with traditional Quaker teaching regarding war and war taxes.\n\nMaule’s critics asked him why he continued to pay other taxes (for instance excise fees) or the remaining portion of his general tax—since surely some of \u003Cem>those\u003C/em> taxes would also go to pay for war.\nOne critic compared Maule to someone trying to avoid getting drunk by finding out the percentage of alcohol in the booze, and then leaving that fraction of each of his drinks unfinished in the glass.\n\nMaule responded by trying to draw a sharp line between ordinary civil taxes, which, like a debt, he must pay regardless of how some of it may be used, and \u003Cem>explicit\u003C/em> war taxes, which fall under a different rule:\n\n> I am not accountable for the acts of other men: if I owe a just debt, I must pay it; if the person receiving the money uses it for a bad purpose, the accountability is with him; but if he demand money of me avowedly to be used in any way to the plundering of my neighbor, destroying his property, or taking his life, then if I furnish money thus demanded I become an accomplice in the evil work and accountable for the sin.\n\nQuaker Samuel Allinson put forward a forceful attack on the tax-as-debt analogy in 1780.\nFirst, he denied outright that God has commanded us to give Caesar anything that Caesar plans to put to a sinful purpose:\n\n> [I]f tribute is demanded for a use that is anti-christian, it seems right for every Christian to deny it, for Caesar can have no title to that which opposes the Lord’s command.\n\nHe then attacked the idea that taxation represents some sort of secularly-contracted debt, or part of an implicit “social contract.”\nAllinson argued that no Christian would agree to the terms of a contract that might require him to do the devil’s work:\n\n> Every valid contract is voluntarily entered into, and as it is the duty of every one previously to see that his engagement is innocent, so when his promise is purchased by a consideration given it would be dishonest and deceitful not to perform it, the other party having, as it were, deposited so much effects in his hands which he is to render back according to agreement, and when received the receiver has a right to apply it as he pleases without any account to the payer.\n> But in the case of taxes he who gives has a right to call to such an account, and therefore seems himself liable for and privy to the application.\n> Every man has or has not given his assent to the government he lives under, in the first, he has formally declared his allegiance thereto, in the latter, that allegiance is implied in consideration of his receiving the protection and benefit of it in the safety of his person and the security of his property, in both, it is no more than to be “true and faithful” which can never mean a compliance with every requisition, for we owe a superior allegiance to the King of Kings, and whenever the requisitions of man run counter thereto we “ought to obey God rather than men”…\n> We have never entered into any contract, express or implied, for the payment of taxes for war, nor the performance of anything contrary to our religious duties…\n\n## Conclusion?\n\nSo have we made any progress here?\nWe’ve reviewed the question of taxpayer complicity from several angles and gotten some historical perspective on how people have wrestled with it.\nI think I’ve at least demonstrated that of the two extreme positions—that paying taxes makes you a fully-guilty accomplice in whatever the government does, or that because paying taxes is a lawful demand it is therefore a decision without personal ethical import—neither can be accepted uncritically.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Note that Chiquita was not charged with conspiring with these Colombian terrorist groups—wasn’t charged as a co-conspirator or accessory in their crimes—but was charged with a distinct crime of providing funds to terrorist organizations.

But that does not matter,” said one.\n> “All excepting the village headman have signed the pledge,” said another, “but the headman is not hostile to us.”\n> “Our Patel has already paid up and a Vania from a neighbouring village also, but we never counted on them,” said a third one.\n> “There is a section among us which is recalcitrant, but we believe as though they were not of us.\n> Our section will never pay, come what may, and trust the rest to the will of God,” said a fourth one.\n> Quite a large majority said: “All have given their signatures. There is no fear of anyone flinching.”\n\nAccording to Mahadev Desai, during the strike “[t]he bond of unity between the cultivating peasants themselves was the Satyagraha pledge.\nThe first month was entirely devoted to taking signatures on the pledge, and the reports from different camps gave minute details about every village:\nthe number of covenanters, shirkers, and whimperers, and the Sardar [commander] had to fix his programme according to the information received each day.”\n\nPeople on the front lines of a resistance movement can also use pledges to communicate to the movement leadership or to each other that their commitment remains strong.\nFor instance, a woman was paying respects to the Bardoli tax strike commander, Vallabhbhai Patel, and handed him a small donation and a note that read:\n\n> We are doing nothing out of the ordinary.\n> This is a fight for our own interest, and for our hearths and homes.\n> I am grateful to you for having taken the Satyagraha pledge from my husband, and I am here to give an additional pledge, that both of us shall willingly put up with whatever suffering that comes to our lot, in the shape of forfeiture of property moveable and immovable.\n> I also promise that should my husband be privileged to be sent to jail, I shall cheerfully bid him godspeed.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> French Liberals\n\nIn 1829 several French newspapers printed the text of a pledge in which French liberals vowed to resist any taxes that the monarchy might try to institute without going through constitutional channels.\nThese newspapers were prosecuted by the crown for printing such a seditious thing, but in court they pointed out that the King himself, along with three other members of the nobility, had once signed a tax resistance pledge to protest against republican infringements on their privileges.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> A Vote in Castine\n\nIn Castine, Maine, in 1975, the “pledge” took the form of a vote:\nat a specially-convened town meeting, the town voted 125 to 65 to refuse to collect a school funding tax—in defiance of a superior court order telling them that they must do so.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Reform Act Vow\n\nThe Reform Act agitation really hit its stride in 1831 when a huge rally—150,000 people strong—vowed with a roar to stop paying taxes until the Act’s passage.\nOne account of the occasion read:\n\n> He declared before God, that, if all constitutional modes of obtaining the success of the reform measure failed, he should and would be the first man to refuse the payment of taxes, except by a levy upon his goods [tremendous cheering, which lasted some minutes].\n> I now call upon all who hear me, and who are prepared to join me in this step, to hold up your hands [an immense forest of hands was immediately elevated, accompanied by vehement cheering].\n> I now call upon you who are not prepared to adopt this course, to hold up your hands and signify your dissent [not a single hand appearing, loud shouts and cheers were repeated].\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> “New Rush”\n\nIn South Africa’s “New Rush” in 1874, a number of miners signed a pledge that read, in part, “I promise on my honour and in presence of the people that I shall not from this day forward—until released from this obligation by the officers of the League—pay any taxes or impositions whatsoever… for the support and maintenance of the Government of this territory; and that I shall buy from, sell to, or deal with only such men as have also taken this pledge or obligation; and that I shall to the utmost of my power, with purse and person, protect any and every officer and member of the League against coercion or consequences of what nature soever arising out of the action necessitated by this pledge.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> American War Tax Resisters\n\n![“If a thousand men were not to pay their tax-bills this year.” We, the undersigned writers and editors, believing that American involvement in Vietnam is morally wrong, pledge: 1.

movement was particularly skilled at this.\nHere is one example:\n\n> [Henrietta Müller], far from relenting to save her property, publicly advertised the date of the seizure, and invited the women of England to come and witness the disgraceful spectacle of a woman being robbed by the minions of the law because she dared to ask for a voice in the disposition of her taxation.\n> The invitation was accepted by hundreds of well-dressed but excited and indignant women, who crowded into Cadogan Square and nearly mobbed the bailiffs while they were removing the lares and penates from the Muller residence.\n> An indignation meeting was afterward held in Miss Muller’s drawing-rooms and many bitter and vehement denunciations of the tyranny and injustice of the law were indulged in.\n\n##

anyway.\nThe couple defied the seizure and continued living in the home until they were arrested in late 1991 and held behind bars while the agency tried to auction off the home.\nBut even that wasn’t the end of the story.\nSympathetic activists continued to occupy the home in week-long shifts, ’round the clock, for 18 months, and they used each Thursday’s “changing of the guard” to stage a

text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Indian Independence Movement\n\nAn important part of the Indian independence struggle was the wearing of \u003Ci>khādī\u003C/i> (homespun cloth).\nThis had three main purposes:\n\n1. to encourage the development of Indian self-reliance and industry as the economic foundation of Indian independence\n1. to hurt the British government by boycotting British fabric and thereby reducing the profitability of the British Empire’s occupation of India\n1. to serve as an emblem to identify and express the commitment of Indian patriots\n\nGandhi wrote:\n\n> [T]he most effective and visible cooperation which all [Indian National] Congressmen and the mute millions can show is by not interfering with the course civil disobedience may take and by themselves spinning and using \u003Ci>khādī\u003C/i> to the exclusion of all other cloth.\n> If it is allowed that there is a meaning in people wearing primroses on Primrose Day, surely there is much more in a people using a particular kind of cloth and giving a particular type of labour to the cause they hold dear.\n> From their compliance with the \u003Ci>khādī\u003C/i> test I shall infer that they have shed untouchability, and that they have nothing but brotherly feeling towards all without distinction of race, colour, or creed.\n> Those who will do this are as much Satyagrahis as those who will be singled out for civil disobedience.\n\nGandhi himself put in many hours at the spinning wheel, and demanded this of his followers as well.\n\n“Gandhi caps” made from \u003Ci>khādī\u003C/i> became almost a uniform of the resistance.\nOne news dispatch from around the time of the Dharasana salt raid noted:\n\n> …the growth of the Gandhi movement was shown by the increased number of persons wearing the Gandhi caps.\n> In the cities… a majority of the people wear them; they also are beginning to be worn in villages in Punjab while even in aristocratic Simla one person in six of the population in the bazaars have donned caps, which is the symbol of the nationalist campaign.\n\n\u003CAside type=\"tip\" title=\"See also\">\n[Boycott Government Monopoly Goods or Particularly Taxed

wasn’t the first blow against the British Empire that was struck by homespun cloth and the conspicuous consumption of locally-manufactured goods.\nThese were also important parts of the American Revolution.\n\nHere is an example reported in a 1770 edition of the \u003Ci>Massachusetts Gazette\u003C/i>:\n\n> On Wednesday evening the honorable speaker and gentlemen of the House of Burgesses gave a ball at the capitol… and it is with the greatest pleasure we inform our readers… [of] the patriotic spirit… manifested in the dress of the ladies on that occasion, who, to the number of near one hundred, appeared in homespun gowns; a lively and striking instance of their acquiescence and concurrence in whatever may be the true and essential interest of their country.\n\nPatriotic Americans worked together at festive “spinning bees” to card, spin, weave, and sew—ways that everybody could demonstrate their revolutionary spirit and participate in the resistance.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca Riots in Wales in the mid-19th century were notorious for the distinctive garb donned by the parties of resisters who would gather to tear down tollgates.\n\nThe leader of each party was usually a man dressed up in women’s clothing and a large bonnet, who sometimes also wore a horse-hair wig or carried a parasol, and who was given the name “Rebecca.”\nRebecca’s followers, or “daughters,” also were men wearing women’s clothes, or at least white blouses over their clothes, and sometimes bonnets or other high-crowned hats, occasionally with fern fronds, feathers, or other decorations on them.\nThey would paint their faces black or yellow, and sometimes drape their horses in white sheets.\n\nIn this case, the point of the costuming was not so much to express public pride as for other purposes, such as:\n\n* to disguise the participants so that the government would be less able to retaliate against them\n* to intimidate toll gate keepers with their strangeness and their reputation\n* to create a fluid figurehead for the movement that could be adopted and then set aside by various people, so as to make the movement less vulnerable to reprisals against its leadership\n* to make the resistance more festive and carnivalesque and thereby encourage participation\n* to make it easier to identify fellow-resisters in the confusion of late-night raids on dark country roads\n* to resonate with ancient folk forms of grassroots vigilantism and protest that had a similar character\n\n\u003CAside

of the Glastonbury Cows\n\nAbby & Julia Smith refused to pay taxes to a local government that denied women the vote (and that took advantage of this by excessively taxing women’s property in order to ease the tax burden on male voters and to redistribute the money to male patronage recipients).\nIn response, the government periodically seized and auctioned off the Smith sisters’ cows (whom they had named “Votey” and “Taxey”).\n\nEmblems made from hairs of the cows’ tails, woven into the shape of flowers and tied with ribbons bearing the slogan “Taxation Without Representation,” became popular adornments for supporters of the Smiths’ tax resistance.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> War Tax Resisters\n\nIn 2007, I spoke at a “Stop Funding the War in Iraq” rally near the offices of a U.S. Congressional leader.\nThe rally was being put on by anti-war groups that were eager to convince Congress to stop funding the war.\nBut the groups hadn’t yet put much thought into the idea that their members could cut off \u003Cem>their\u003C/em> war funding by resisting taxes.\n\nBut a local war tax resistance group was there, handing out stickers for people to wear that read “I refuse to fund this war!”\nJust about everybody who was offered a sticker was eager to wear one, agreeing with the sentiment at least—one that harmonized with the theme of the day, but that pointedly made it more personal.\nPerhaps a few protesters then looked around and wondered: “Has everyone else here started resisting \u003Cem>their\u003C/em> taxes? Maybe it’s time for me to start.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Fries Rebellion\n\nThe Fries Rebellion in the United States took place about a decade after the United States Constitution came into force, and soon after the success of the French Revolution.\nThe president of the U.S. government at the time was John Adams, who, despite his revolutionary credentials, represented the more authoritarian, aristocratic, pro-English political faction.\nThe faction that was out of power was more populist, democratic, and pro-French.\n\nTax resisters who participated in the Fries Rebellion sometimes wore French tricolor cockades in their hats to show their affinity with the democratic revolutionaries across the pond.\nOthers wore their old American revolutionary militia uniforms to demonstrate their belief that the current rebellion was more in harmony with the spirit of the American Revolution than were the policies of the Adams administration.\n\n##

\u003Ci>pizzo\u003C/i>-free.\n\nThough it might seem that such signs would invite trouble from a mafia that notoriously relies on credible threats to keep its coffers full, the Addiopizzo movement has

resistance.\nThis can short-circuit the traditional government gambit of publishing the names of tax evaders to try to shame them as bankrupts or deadbeats.\nIf the government tries to shame tax resisters in this way, but the resisters have already eagerly made their resistance public, this gambit loses its power.\n\nWhen local governments in the U.K. tried this against poll tax resisters in the Thatcher years, the newspapers who published the lists of “shame” got letters from resisters who were outraged that they had not made the list—and who insisted that their names be included too!\n\nThe Women’s Freedom League was a British women’s suffrage activist group that refused to pay taxes on the salaries of its employees.\nWhen it was threatened with a legal writ by the government, it decided to auction the writ in a fundraiser as though it were a treasured award.\n\nGreek tax resisters in Penteli (near Athens) refused to pay new taxes the government had added to their utility bills.\nTo express their communal pride in resistance they hung their urgent “past due” notices from a Christmas tree in the town square as ornaments.\n\nWhen the IRS levied war tax resister Thad Crouch’s salary, he remembers:\n\n> How fortunate to be levied a week before tax day.\n> What a great media hook!\n> …[N]ot only would I publicly refuse to pay my taxes, I would throw a party to rejoice in my religious persecution and \u003Cem>I would invite the IRS!\u003C/em>…\n>\n> About forty people ranging from six months to 70 years old enjoyed that fun-filled night as we sang, beat drums, recited poems, and laughed beneath the “peace tax cranes.”\n> A friend and I made origami peace cranes from tax returns and strung them from the ceiling.\n> Midway through the party I took just a few minutes to thank everyone for coming.\n> I explained my WTR [war tax resistance], the Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund, and why I was rejoicing in a levy.\n>\n> …The most popular question was “Did you really invite the IRS?”\n> We were happy not only to answer yes, but also to entertain guests with the voice mail message of an Austin IRS agent thanking me for the invitation but declining on behalf of their office.\n> Guests howled with laughter that I hope dispelled their fears as it had done mine the week before.\n>\n> …So the next time the collection agent comes knocking and you find yourself faced with tough decisions, stress and fear, take time to rejoice.\n> Laugh, throw a party, educate others, and dispel fear!\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes

Justice.](../../../assets/labor-note.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>one of Josiah Warren’s “labor notes”\u003C/figcaption>\n\nSome campaigns have developed alternative currencies that facilitate tax resistance.\nThere are several reasons why some tax resisters find alternative currencies attractive:\n\n1. **the “inflation tax”**\u003Cbr />\n   Most government-backed currencies are subject to inflation, which benefits the government at the expense of currency users.\n   If the government has a monopoly on issuing money, it can manipulate the currency supply and generate a stealth tax that tax resisters can’t easily avoid.\n1. **anarchist principles**\u003Cbr />\n   American anarchists like Josiah Warren, William B. Greene, and Benjamin Tucker challenged the government monopoly on currency as part of their critiques of coercive government.\n   Warren’s “labor notes” are one early 19th century ancestor of the “Time Dollars” that are currently in use in some areas of the United States (see below).\n1. **privacy / secrecy**\u003Cbr />\n   If you can remove yourself from the government’s money system, perhaps you can keep the government from finding out about your earnings and spending altogether—and can thereby make these activities more difficult to tax.\n   So much of the early cyberpunk sci-fi took for granted a future in which anonymous, encrypted micro-payments were going to be flying through the wires faster than any government could track them.\n   (The founders of PayPal were hoping to turn this sci-fi dream into reality and, for a while, they fully intended their service to empower people and disempower governments.)\n\n   John T. Kennedy, writing of what he calls “economic secession,” put it this way:\n\n   > Think of how much less profitable taxation would be if government didn’t know how much money you earned or how much money you had.\n   > The Leviathan cannot extract the revenue necessary to sustain itself at anything like current levels without knowing where the money is.…\n   > if the means of economic privacy are available [people] must choose between keeping their own money in their own pockets or voluntarily turning it over to government.\n   > Then you’ll see economic secession on a grand scale.\n\nHere are some examples of how people have used alternative currencies to facilitate or augment tax resistance:\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Time Dollars\n\nThe state of Missouri issued what it called “Time Dollars” to people who volunteered to spend their time helping the elderly.\nThese volunteers could in turn use their Time Dollars to hire similar help if they needed it later on.\nThe state promised that it would honor these Time Dollars itself if no home care workers were available who would accept such currency.\nAlthough Missouri did not have a tax resistance motive in establishing this program, in 1985 they sought (and eventually obtained) an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruling that Time Dollars were not taxable income.\n\nMany alternative currency projects in the United States are trying to follow the Time Dollar model, in some cases with the explicit goal of helping tax resisters.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Norraths, Britannian gold pieces, & QQ coins\n\nThe in-game currencies used in massively-multiplayer online (MMO) games are also plausible challengers to legal tender.\n\nIf you’ve never played one of these games, you may be surprised at just how huge they have become, and just how many transactions take place in these fantasy currencies.\nAnd because players can sell their hard-won game-world prizes on real-world auction sites like eBay, it has become possible to exchange virtual money for real goods, real money for virtual goods, or virtual money for real money.\nIn 2001, an economist took the time to figure out what the exchange rate was between EverQuest Norraths and U.S. Dollars, and he concluded:\n\n> [EverQuest has] the 77th largest economy in the world.\n> [It] has a gross national product per capita of $2,266, making its economy larger than either the Chinese or Indian economy and roughly comparable to Russia’s economy.…\n>\n> The nominal hourly wage is about $3.42 per hour, and the labors of the people produce a GNP per capita somewhere between that of Russia and Bulgaria.\n> A unit of Norrath’s currency is traded on exchange markets at $0.0107, higher than the yen and the lira.\n> The economy is characterized by extreme inequality, yet life there is quite attractive to many.\n\nNote that when he says that EverQuest had the 77th largest economy in the world, he means the \u003Cem>real\u003C/em> world.\nTax agencies do not yet tax this thriving economy, though most of its transactions are (in theory at least) easily-traceable.\nJulian Dibbell wondered why the tax collector hasn’t come calling yet:\n\n> If you haven’t misspent hours battling an Arctic Ogre Lord near an Ice Dungeon or been equally profligate spending time reading the published works of the Internal Revenue Service, you probably haven’t wondered whether the United States government will someday tax your virtual winnings from games played over the Internet.\n> The real question is: Why hasn’t it happened already?\n>\n> …if you look on online marketplaces like eBay today, you will find a thriving, multimillion-dollar market in Golden Runic Hammers, Ethereal Mounts, and similarly exotic items—all of them won (and anything found or wrested from another player is “won” in the context of a game) or bartered for in this or that MMO quest, and many of them fetching prices in the hundreds, even thousands of dollars.\n\nDibbell tried to figure out how he \u003Cem>would\u003C/em> declare income earned in the course of the game if he wanted to.\nHe turned to an IRS instruction guide, which he found to include sections on “every conceivable form of income known to accounting”:\n\n> To read it once is to realize that you know nothing about income.\n> Here you’ll find a description of gains, ill-gotten and otherwise, so irregular that they can be taxed only according to that form of guesswork known as fair market value.\n> Here are stocks, options, retirement watches, and stolen goods (“If you steal property, you must report its fair market value in your income in the year you steal it unless in the same year, you return it to its rightful owner”).\n\nHe determined that “items acquired either through barter or as prizes in a game” is the closest category.\nBut then it got tricky:\n\n> Goods taken in trade or won at play are taxable the moment they fall into somebody’s hands, even if they are not sold for money.\n> The more I read, the more I wondered whether reporting the amount I had brought home from selling virtual items on eBay was enough to satisfy the IRS.\n>\n> What about the assets I bartered for or won in the game but never sold in the real world, the suits of armor stashed here and there with their easily established fair market value?\n> What if I traded those assets for their value in Ultima Online’s official currency, the Britannian gold piece, rather than for dollars?\n> Wouldn’t it be easy to establish their value in dollars nonetheless and, if I owed American taxes on the exchange, put a number on the deal that the IRS could grasp and love?\n> And what about all the other MMO players out there—how long could the IRS be expected in good conscience to leave the resulting millions of dollars in wealth untouched?\n\nHilarious!\nImagine opening the treasure chest behind the dragon you just dispatched in a video game, only to find that it was one-third empty thanks to income tax withholding!\nIs the virtual chainmail armor that your character bought a business expense, and if so, how should you handle depreciation?\nCan you imagine?\n\nBut the government has two choices: either enlist an army of IRS accountants and lawyers to come up with just these sorts of absurd regulation, or allow a huge virtual economy, at which many of its citizens fruitfully labor for hours and hours, to go untaxed… and potentially to spill out into the real-world economy.\n\nHere’s another example:\nA silly on-line currency called the “QQ coin” became a craze in China, and exposed a latent demand for an alternative to the tightly-controlled legal tender there.\n\n> In some rural areas, where debit and credit cards are scarce, stores began to accept QQ coins as payment for real goods and services.…\n>\n> “QQ coins were being traded with such volume and frequency that they did start to drag down the value of the \u003Ci>yuan\u003C/i>,” one financial analyst told the \u003Ci>Wall Street Journal\u003C/i>.\n> In other words, demand was so great that QQ coins began to have more buying power than genuine Chinese banknotes.…\n>\n> The growing impact of QQ coins was also enough to worry top government ministries in China, including the central bank, which announced it was “on the lookout for any assault by such virtual currencies on the real economic and financial order.”\n\n> The coins have also become the medium of exchange for online gambling and money laundering, said an executive of another online game operator.\n>\n> “Once the money becomes QQ coins, it can be transferred anywhere electronically,” he said.…\n>\n> Online auction sites… are part of the problem as they allow users quick and easy exchange of QQ coins back to real money.\n>\n> More than 100,000 auctions of discounted QQ coins happen on Taobao each day, according to mainland media, with transaction volume reaching an annual 200 million \u003Ci>yuan\u003C/i>.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Honor Bonds\n\nFor a time in the United States, you could go to a bank and buy an “honor bond” (or “bearer bond”) for the face value of your purchase.\nSuch bonds were anonymous—anyone could redeem them, not just the person to whom they were issued.\nAnd they earned interest.\nSo for a certain class of savvy people, tax resisters in particular, they were better than money for conducting high-denomination transactions.\nThe government has since cracked down on the practice.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Liberty Dollars\n\nThe U.S. government also tightened the screws on a fellow who coined a currency called the “Liberty Dollar” that he hoped would be more reliable and valuable than the stuff they print out at the Mint—but not before some sixty million dollars worth of the currency were in circulation.\nThe government felt so threatened by this competitor that it convicted him of criminal charges in 2011 and confiscated the precious metal that his organization was using to mint its coins and to back its paper currency, on the grounds that the Liberty Dollar project amounted to money laundering, mail fraud, wire fraud, counterfeiting, and conspiracy.\n\nThe federal prosecutor in charge of the case said, after winning the conviction:\n\n> Attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism.\n> While these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence, they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of this country.\n> We are determined to meet these threats through infiltration, disruption, and dismantling of organizations which seek to challenge the legitimacy of our democratic form of government.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Tems\n\nIn modern Greece, people turned with creativity born of desperation to a variety of alternative economic tactics, including the use of an alternative currency called “\u003Ci>tems\u003C/i>” that the Greek government has not yet figured out how to tax.\n\nPeople can join the \u003Ci>tems\u003C/i> network and immediately start paying for goods and services by using a web-based interface to transfer some amount of this internet-based currency.\nThis puts them into debt by however much they transfer, a debt that they can pay off by providing goods or services to another person in the network, who pays them with their own

text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Bitcoin\n\nAs I was preparing this book, the alternative currency on the rise was “bitcoin,” a form of currency that is backed by the full faith & credit of its community of users and the sophisticated and clever algorithm that gives the currency value as a medium of exchange.\n\nBitcoins are composed of numbers, are minted by mathematics, usually never take material form, are rarely recognized as legal tender, and are backed by no material goods… and yet they seem strikingly more secure and useful and dependable, at least in some ways, than the currencies we have grown used to (for which, on close inspection, many of these same frightening conclusions hold true).\n\nHere is an example of people using bitcoin to facilitate tax resistance:\n“Fr33 Aid” is a group of volunteers who organize free first aid and health services and who educate people about first aid skills (like CPR) and about the value of voluntary mutual aid at libertarian/anarchist-leaning conferences and other events in the United States.\nOn tax day in 2013, the group announced that they were giving up on their frustrating quest to gain government-certified nonprofit status.\nThey said they would instead withdraw from the state-monitored banking system and from state-controlled currency and instead do as much of their operations as possible in bitcoin.\n\n“When we founded Fr33 Aid in early 2011, the banks all required a taxpayer ID number and government paperwork,” said Teresa Warmke, Fr33 Aid’s co-founder and treasurer.\n“Bitcoin changed everything.\nWe can focus on our mission now that Fr33 Aid’s assets are safe in our Bitcoin wallet.”\n\nShe explained:\n“Now that there are ways for us to do banking without government involvement, we decided fulfilling [onerous IRS requirements for nonprofits] would not be a responsible way for Fr33 Aid to spend its money nor for our volunteers to spend their time.”\n\nThe organization continued to accept donations denominated in dollars from people who have not yet adopted bitcoin, but converted such donations to bitcoin “in a timely manner.”\nThis way, Warmke says:\n“If at some point either the bank or a government tries to confiscate our account for taxes they believe we owe or failure to file paperwork, they would only be able to find a few dollars for their trouble.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Warren, Josiah \u003Ci>Equitable Commerce\u003C/i> (1852) and \u003Ci>True

text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> On-Line Sharing Networks\n\nIt is increasingly easy to get your needs met by engaging in off-the-books transactions—not just under-the-table cash payments or barter, but also swaps and freebies.\nA number of websites and other innovative projects (many now defunct) have facilitated things like this.\nYou could go to yerdle or ShareTribe or [Trade A Favor](https://tradeafavor.com/), for instance, and join a community of sharers, or you could “turn what you have into what you want” at swap.com, or you could visit the “barter” or “free” sections at your local [craigslist](https://craigslist.org/), or find a neighbor with a hedge trimmer you can borrow at NeighborGoods, or swap the books you’ve finished for ones you’d like to read at [PaperBack Swap](https://www.paperbackswap.com/index.php), or pass along the clothes your child just outgrew through [thredUP](https://www.thredup.com/), or rent a car from a person rather than an agency with [Getaround](https://getaround.com/), or join your local [Freecycle](https://www.freecycle.org/) network to help useful stuff find good homes.\nAnd of course swap meets and garage sales survive (still mostly untaxed) from the horse-and-buggy days before the World Wide Web.\n\nAside from the benefit of taking transactions out of the taxed economy, sharing networks like these can be helpful ways of promoting and developing solidarity and grassroots mutual reliance at a time when the marketplace is becoming increasingly impersonal and when corporations and governments have become thoroughly codependent.\nThis too can be of benefit to some varieties of tax resistance campaigns.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Hess, Karl “Bartering”

Adams and his fellow patriots.\nResisters boycotted monopoly tea, and backed up this boycott with actions like the Boston Tea Party, in which they destroyed monopoly tea before it reached the marketplace.\n\nOther monopoly British imports that suffered from the American boycott included paper, cloth, dye, house paint, and glass.\nOne patriotic song celebrated the boycott (while at the same time educating listeners about its extent) in this way:\n\n> The use of the taxables, let us forbear:—\u003Cbr />\n> (Then merchants import till your stores are all full,\u003Cbr />\n> May the buyers be few, and your traffic be dull!)…\n>\n> …rather than freedom we part with our tea,\u003Cbr />\n> And well as we love the dear draught when a-dry,\u003Cbr />\n> As American Patriots our taste we

like salt and cloth.\nThe campaign not only encouraged people to wear only Indian-produced fabric and clothing, but it also held bonfires and asked people to burn all of the British cloth they owned.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> American War Tax Resisters\n\nDuring the American war on Vietnam, “[o]ne pacifist, imprisoned for draft refusal and therefore lacking income to refuse taxes on, gave up smoking because the cigarette tax brings the government more revenue than any other single consumer-commodity tax.”\n\nAs internet telephony started to become an option, some American war tax resisters realized they could avoid the federal excise tax on telephone service by getting rid of their phone lines and switching to such internet-based plans.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Quakers\n\nWhen the Continental Congress imposed a tax on postage stamps to help pay for the American revolutionary war effort, Quaker James Mott stopped using the mail.\nHe wrote to a friend shortly before the tax came into effect:\n\n> Must our correspondence by mail be at end, in consequence of the extra postage?\n> or shall we pay it, and thereby contribute a mite to the support of measures calculated to destroy men’s lives and property?\n> Perhaps I may be alone in refusing to pay postage on letters.\n> Only a few cents—what can this do, it may be said, towards enabling government to prosecute the war?\n> Very little, I own: but the great sum required is made up of littles; and if all those littles are withheld, the effusion of human blood may be at an end.\n\nMany years later, Congress issued revenue stamps that it required people to purchase and to apply to certain types of documents.\nOne Quaker wrote in 1900:\n\n> I am one of those (I suppose there are others), who have felt an extreme unwillingness to help maintain our wars by the use of the revenue stamps, which were legalized expressly for war uses.\n> Our forefathers would have made an emphatic protest against it, if indeed they would not have refused entirely to use the stamps, and borne the consequences, whatever they might have been.…\n> at least we could restrict the use of checks (for example) wherever possible, and diminish in this way our contributions to the war fund.\n\nOther Quakers, like Isaac Martin, refused to use or to deal in imported goods, so as to avoid paying import duties that were directed to military expenses:\n\n> [A] weighty concern attended my mind on account of a tax on shop keepers who dealt in foreign articles, to be appropriated towards carrying on the war against England.…\n> I believed my peace of mind would be affected if I paid the said tax.\n> So I resigned myself to the Lord’s will, let the event be as it may.\n> But scarcely a day passed, that I had not to turn customers away who applied for articles which I had on hand, but could not sell, on account of the heavy penalty.\n\nMany Quaker meetings also had a policy of warning their members against “sharing or partaking in the spoils of war by purchasing or selling prize-goods”—that is, goods seized from the ships of enemy nations by government-sanctioned pirates.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War the North Columbus, Ohio, Friends Meeting was unable to agree on whether to reluctantly pay the federal excise tax on its office phone (a tax that had been extended to help pay for the war) or whether to illegally resist it.\nAs a compromise, the meeting decided to discontinue its phone service entirely.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Anti-Czarist Activism\n\nIn Russia around the time of the Vyborg Manifesto, a report noted that “the peasants are deciding to boycott all state-owned businesses.”\nFor example: “they have undertaken a concerted abstention from vodka, the manufacture and sale of which intoxicant was made a Government monopoly… [which] has since constituted one of the principal sources of the public revenue.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Examples\" size=\"medium\" /> Obstructing in Addition to Boycotting\n\nYou can augment a boycott by obstructing the sale of boycotted goods:\n\n* In Wales, truckers blockaded a Chevron refinery and called upon the tanker operators to join them in shutting it down, to protest the government’s tax on fuel.\n* Farmers in Argentina decided in 2009 to “halt sales of grains and livestock for a week, setting up roadblocks and hampering exports to press for lower taxes.”\n* In Greece, resisters to taxes that were added to utility bills barricaded the offices of utility companies.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Examples\" size=\"medium\" /> Divestment and Boycotts of Nations\n\nIn 2003, as the U.S. was launching its attack on Iraq, anti-war activists from other countries promoted a boycott of the products of U.S. government contractors, and even of U.S. companies in general.\n“The U.S. economy is strung out across the globe. Its economic outposts are exposed and vulnerable,” wrote Arundhati Roy.\n“Our strategy must be to isolate Empire’s working parts and disable them one by one.\nNo target is too small.\nNo victory too insignificant.”\n\nSimilarly, the “Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions” movement aims to boycott businesses that profit from Israeli settlement expansion in occupied Palestine.\n\nThe model for this approach is the movement that promoted divestment from apartheid South Africa.\nThat movement, which peaked in the 1980s, successfully pressured businesses, governments, and other institutions around the world to restrict or abandon their economic support for the regime and for those businesses that helped to prop it up.\nUniversities, targeted by persistent student activists, were among the more prominent institutions to divest from companies doing business in South Africa.\nIn one fell swoop in 1986, the entire University of California system divested itself of some $3 billion in apartheid-tainted investments.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Adams, Samuel \u003Ci>The Writings of Samuel Adams\u003C/i> Vol. I (1904) p. 142\n* Griffitts, Hannah “The Daughters of Liberty” \u003Ci>We Won’t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader\u003C/i> (2008), p. 86\n* Love, Kennett “Tax Resistance: Hell No—I Won’t Pay” \u003Ci>Washington Monthly\u003C/i> December 1969, pp. 60–65\n* Mott, James “The Postage Tax” \u003Ci>American Quaker War Tax Resistance\u003C/i>, 2nd. ed.

they did they would never again be able to do business with the peasants.\n> One day three peasants even appeared in the slaughter yards at Hamburg and announced that unless the distrained cattle

his depositors, mostly Germans, or of German parentage, have withdrawn many thousands of dollars from his bank because he aided the First Liberty Loan.\n>\n> These depositors, he added, had taken

owe income taxes because their income is too low, but who want to be income tax resisters:\nDeliberately inflate your declared income with “phantom income” when you file your tax return so that you owe some small amount that you can then resist.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Pulpit Freedom Sunday\n\nA number of American preachers have made explicit political endorsements from the pulpit—and have even recorded these endorsements and sent the recordings to the government as proof.\nIn the United States, tax-exempt organizations like churches are not permitted to engage in political campaigns in this way.\nThe churches dare the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to rescind the tax exemption of their churches, and frame it as a freedom-of-speech/freedom-of-religion issue.\nThe number of churches participating in this protest tactic rose from a few dozen to over a thousand, but the IRS has yet to take up their challenge.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Examples\" size=\"medium\" /> Troubles with Tax-Exempt Status\n\nThe legal conditions of tax-exempt, nonprofit status in the United States have proven to be a powerful way for the government to make activist groups timid.\n\nAt one point the largely-liberal-leaning staff of the IRS was caught applying extraordinary and extra-legal scrutiny to the applications for tax-exempt status made by conservative groups.\nIn one case, they told the board of an anti-abortion group to sign an affidavit swearing that the group would not hold or sponsor protests at family planning clinics, as a condition of being granted tax-exempt status.\nAnother anti-abortion group was told that because its outreach material was “condemnatory and opinionated” with “no intelligent discussion of the subject of abortions” and because its activities “are designed to influence public opinion in favor of its advocated position” the group risked having its application denied.\n\nAnti-abortion tax resister Jerry DePyper noted that this sort of thing has been successful at intimidating the larger anti-abortion groups and was a big reason why he was making no headway in trying to get the tax resistance tactic on their agenda.\nHe spoke with two leaders in that movement and said:\n“Both… say that no recognized pro-life leader would want to risk it because of the legal issues with the IRS, and they don’t want to lose their tax-exempt status.”\n\nRuth Benn of the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee (NWTRCC) had a similar experience:\n\n> I was talking about a potential war tax resistance workshop with a group for which I have great respect and who are very supportive of war tax resistance.\n> When I suggested a certain activity as part of the workshop, the organizer hurriedly said, “Oh, no, we couldn’t sponsor that; we’re 501(c)3 [the section of the legal code that governs tax-exempt non-profits].”\n\nFor this and related reasons, some tax resisting groups, like Catholic Worker and NWTRCC, have never tried to apply for tax-exempt nonprofit status.\nIn 1972 the IRS told Catholic Worker that it owed some $300,000 in taxes and penalties because of this (the tax agency eventually retreated, acknowledging that Catholic Worker was a \u003Ci>de facto\u003C/i> nonprofit charity, even if it was never going to fill out the \u003Ci>de jure\u003C/i> paperwork).\n\nThis episode turned out to be a good propaganda opportunity for Catholic Worker.\nThe \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> editorialized:\n“Surely the IRS must have genuine frauds to investigate.\nSurely there must be some worthwhile work this agency could be doing instead of obstructing acts of corporal mercy for the poor.”\nDorothy Day added:\n\n> The \u003Ci>New York Evening Post\u003C/i> also editorialized on our situation.\n> The \u003Ci>National Catholic Reporter\u003C/i> and the \u003Ci>Commonweal\u003C/i> editors also registered their protest and other papers followed suit.\n> Letters come in daily from our friends, reassuring, comforting, indignant at the government, a few of them indignant at us, that we cause them so much worry.…\n>\n> …[T]he CW refuses to pay taxes, or to “structure itself” so as to be exempt from taxes.\n> We are afraid of that word “structure.”\n> We refuse to become a “corporation.”…\n> [W]e do not intend to “incorporate” the Catholic Worker movement.\n\n\u003Chr

campaigns, not everybody can be a tax resister.\nPerhaps only some people are subject to the tax being resisted.\nOr maybe the point of the resistance is that some particular group of people who are being taxed ought not to be, and so only that group of people is resisting.\n\nTax resistance campaigns can inspire people who aren’t resisting the tax to show solidarity in other ways.\nThey can also suggest roles that non-resisting sympathizers can play in the campaign.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nThe success of the anti-poll tax movement in Thatcher’s Britain relied on mass popular support.\nThe Anti-Poll Tax Unions “had to make people feel wanted and included and give everyone a sense that they had a role,” said movement chronicler Danny Burns.\n“In order to sustain a long and protracted struggle, it was necessary for as many people as possible to feel responsible for some aspect of the movement, however small.”\n\nHe gave some examples:\n“In the fight against the bailiffs and sheriff officers, the kids hanging around the streets passed on the word as soon as they saw a suspicious-looking character.\nParents and pensioners who were not out at work organised telephone trees and were ready to be at each others’ houses at short notice.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nThe Bardoli tax strike was deliberately limited to a particular region with a particular tax grievance.\nBut it was also a test run of the use of organized nonviolent action to force government concessions—so the rest of India was watching closely.\nMany outsiders also wanted to lend a hand, or at least to donate money to the cause.\n\n> The suggestion… that the 12th of June should be celebrated throughout the country as the Bardoli Day was backed by Gandhiji and the President of the Congress, and there was hardly a city or town of note in India, and hardly a village of note in Gujarat, but celebrated the day with \u003Ci>hartals\u003C/i> and processions and collections and meetings.…\n>\n> The awakening among the youth in Bombay was immense.\n> They went from door to door making collections, and organised early in July a Bardoli Day of their own, led a successful procession in pouring rain, money pouring in the Sardar’s car as it threaded its way through the crowds.\n> Various purses amounting to over Rs.24,000 were presented to the Sardar at the meeting in the Empire theatre, where the youth honoured the beloved leader and received with applause his call to go and have their first lessons in public service in the Bardoli University.\n>\n> The Satyagraha Fund met with a response almost unique in the history of the nation.\n> Cheques and money orders were received every day at Bardoli, at Satyagraha Ashram and at the \u003Ci>Navajivan\u003C/i> and \u003Ci>Young India\u003C/i> offices.\n> The contributions came not only from all the provinces, but from the most distant parts of the land, not only from distant lands like France, Belgium, Japan, and China, but from the most remote corners of the globe including New Zealand, Malay States, and Fiji.…\n>\n> Bombay had several meetings addressed by that expert national beggar Manilal Kothari who levied his tribute of handsome amounts from barristers and advocates some of whom had never contributed towards a movement of this kind.\n> Anything was acceptable to him.\n> “If you cannot give a handsome cheque, you can give your car,” he would say in his seductive way, and thanks to his efforts, the workers in Bardoli had timely use of no less than four cars to help their whirlwind campaign.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca Rioters knew how to make their tollgate demolishing popular among people who couldn’t (or wouldn’t) participate directly.\n\nOn the night before market day in Cardigan, Rebeccaites destroyed the Rhos Gate, the Rhydyfuwch Gate, and the gate on the Llangoedmore road near Cardigan.\nWhen the market opened, “every one who drove in was exempted from paying the usual toll, except those who came over the coach-road.\nThe people, looking at things from that point of view, were filled with Rebeccaite enthusiasm.\nOn that day nothing was heard at public-houses but proposals of good health and long life to Rebecca.”\n\nOn another occasion, Rebecca and her daughters pointedly left intact the gates on “the Queen’s high road” but destroyed those on roads that the various parishes were required to maintain.\n“This rendered Rebecca not unpopular amongst some farmers and others, many of whom paid the fine rather than be sworn in as special constables [to hunt for Rebecca and her daughters].”\n\nThe Rebeccaites also sometimes resorted to threats to induce reluctant bystanders to participate.\nIn one example:\n\n> All male inhabitants being householders of the hundred [district], were to meet at eleven o’clock on the following Thursday, at the “Plough and Harrow,” Newchurch parish, to march in procession to Carmarthen—to defy the Mayor and magistrates, and to destroy the gate on their return.\n> Rich and poor were to be compelled to attend, and in case of illness a substitute must be found.\n> All owners of horses were to ride.\n> All persons absent without a sufficient excuse or substitute were to have their houses and barns destroyed by fire.\n\nIn another example:\n\n> [I]n order to ensure a full attendance of her followers, the church doors in the neighbourhood of Elvet were covered with notices in the dead of night, signed by “’Becca,” commanding all males above the age of sixteen and under seventy to appear at the “Plough and Harrow” on the morning of the 19th under pain of having their houses burnt and their lives sacrificed.\n> The time and place of meeting were also published by word of mouth at most of the Dissenting meeting-houses throughout the hundred, and wherever a disinclination was known to exist on the part of any person to join in the procession and to take part in the intended proceedings, he was privately admonished if he wished to protect his property from the firebrand of the midnight incendiary, and to excuse himself from personal injury, that he had better join the procession—“or else.”\n> This species of intimidation had the effect of drawing together immense numbers to the place of rendezvous.\n\nAt one point the Rebeccaites threatened an attorney in order to make him join them on one of their destructive sprees, “so that if any proceedings were subsequently taken, he as local solicitor might be made a party to them.”\nThey sometimes also forced the toll gate operators to take part in the destruction of their own toll houses.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Beit Sahour\n\nWhen residents of Beit Sahour launched a tax strike against the Israeli occupation, Israel put the town under siege.\nChristian groups

Armenian Orthodox churches.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nSome men who were sympathetic to the tax resistance campaign of the Women’s Tax

the entrepreneurial wealth-creators in the United States quietly go on strike, one at a time, until the government finds itself with less and less to siphon off and has to resort to increasingly desperate (and eventually fruitless) measures to stay afloat.\nRand’s working title for the novel was “The Strike.”\nBut strikes by business people are not only a thing of fiction.\n\nBusiness strikes can add emphasis to a tax strike.\nThey also, by reducing the base of taxable commercial transactions, can be a form of tax resistance.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Indian Hartals\n\nIn 1810 in Benares, the British imperial government tried to impose a house tax.\nThe residents responded with a \u003Ci>hartal\u003C/i>, or general strike:\n> [T]he shops were closed, every kind of occupation was abandoned… a solemn engagement was taken by all the inhabitants to carry on no manner of work or business until the tax was repealed.\n> Everything was at a stand:\n> the dead bodies were cast unceremoniously into the river, because there were none to perform the obsequial rites; and the very thieves refrained from the exercise of their vocation…\n\nThe extended \u003Ci>hartal\u003C/i> was successful, and the Raj dropped the offensive tax.\n\nThe later Indian independence movement frequently used \u003Ci>hartals\u003C/i> and strikes, sometimes in coordination with tax resistance tactics such as the salt raids.\nDuring the Bardoli tax strike, for example, shopkeepers frequently shut down their operations whenever officials came to town, and hartals sometimes broke out spontaneously on other occasions.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Bob Williams\n\nWhen American farmer Bob Williams was filling out his tax return in 2008, he reflected on the “bombs and bullets” that his tax dollars would help to pay for.\n“I thought, ‘This is terrible, I don’t want to open,’ Why should I make this extra money?”\nHe decided that from then on, he would donate all of his produce to charity rather than sell it for taxable income.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Palestine\n\nDuring the first intifada in Palestine, the Unified National Command responded to a crackdown on the tax strikers of Beit Sahour by calling “an unprecedented five day in six general strike,” while “[s]torekeepers in the town launched a commercial strike that lasted three months…”\nThe Israeli practice of seizing equipment, supplies, and goods from businesses that refused to remit taxes also had the effect of putting those businesses into a state of strike whether or not that was their intention.\n\nIn 1981, in support of Palestinian doctors who were refusing to pay an Israeli income tax, shopkeepers in Gaza City launched multiple two-day strikes.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Ruhrkampf\n\nIn the Ruhr, during the French/Belgian occupation of 1923, businesses shut down rather than pay reparation

Venezuelan Oil Industry\n\nA strike can deprive a government of funds, and can thereby work in harmony with a tax strike that is being used as a nonviolent resistance tactic.\nFor example, a tax

drivers, cooks, waiters, and messengers.”\nIt succeeded in forcing the government to rescind the tax.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> American Prisoners\n\nSlave laborers in several prisons in the American state of Georgia went on strike in 2010, refusing to contribute to the profit of the prison system.\nThey coordinated their daring strike between the prisons by using contraband cell phones.\n“We’re hearing in the news that they’re putting it down as a prison riot, so [the authorities say they] locked the prison down,” one striker said.\nNot true: “We locked ourselves down.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Georgia Dockworkers\n\nA strike can also be an additional pressure tactic in a campaign to have a tax abolished.\nIn the U.S. city of Savannah, Georgia, in 1867, the government tried to impose a $10 tax on “stevedores and other laborers on the wharves.”\nThe workers refused to pay and the city locked them out of the wharves.\n\n> This, of course, seriously interfered with the shipping interests of the city, and the Council, finding that the laborers were not at all disposed to yield, and that meanwhile the “strike” was damaging the business community to the amount of thousands of dollars, and was driving all the vessels from this to other ports, met and reduced the tax to $3.\n> This, however, only tended to increase the feelings of the laborers, who had resolved not to pay any tax whatever, deeming it unjust, unconstitutional and oppressive to tax unskilled labor, and they determined that none of their number should work, whether they paid the tax or not.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> French Ship Stokers\n\nShip stokers in France went on strike in 1923 when the government tried to tax their incidental benefits (like the meals they ate while on ship) as income.\nThe standoff kept the largest French trans-Atlantic ship stranded in port until the stokers’ employer agreed to pay the extra tax on their behalf.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Irish Civil and Public Service Workers\n\nThe threat of a strike can also dissuade the

lamb or mutton in order to encourage American woolen manufactures.\n>\n> In less than a year the boycott had so disrupted Transatlantic trade that thousands of British workers lost their jobs.\n\nGatherings at which dozens of people would card and spin yarn, weave fabric, or sew clothing were simultaneously acts of resistance and patriotic rallies.\nTowns competed with each other over how many yards of cloth they could produce, and the results of such contests were reported in the newspapers.\nAt society balls, a woman who turned up in anything but a homespun cloth dress risked being shunned.\n\n> …at the first commencement exercises of Rhode Island College (later Brown University), the president proud-spiritedly wore wholly homespun clothing.\n> At Harvard, the faculty and students had all taken to homespun in support of their women spinners, of whom the Boston Chronicle had bragged “[T]hey exhibited a fine example of industry, by spinning from sunrise until dark, and

but that this necessity should be relieved by monthly and quarterly meetings, and thereby preserve our religious testimony against the anti-christian practice of war, and manifest their sympathy for their brethren, by contributing to their comfortable support.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Ghis\n\nGhislaine “Ghis” Lanctôt embarked on a project of absolute individual independence from the governments of the world—something she calls “personocratia”—in the early 1990s.\nShe refused to cooperate with the government in any way, but she also took a careful inventory of the benefits and privileges of citizenship, and was careful to reject those too.\n\nShe started by giving up her state health insurance card, and later discarded her driver’s license and stopped paying traffic fines, gave up her claim to a family trust, and eventually let her passport expire.\nIn the course of her endeavor, she made a list of various state privileges that she was turning her back on: social security, professional licensing, insurance, legally protected property, certifications, intellectual property rights, the courts, access to banks, and so forth.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Beit Sahour\n\nIn Beit Sahour, during the first intifada, Israeli military occupation authorities would retaliate against tax resisters by seizing their identity cards.\nThis made it difficult for these resisters to travel, get medical care, be employed, avoid arbitrary arrest, or “to pursue anything resembling a normal life under occupation.”\nBut the people of Beit Sahour fought back in a daring fashion:\nHundreds of them \u003Cem>voluntarily\u003C/em> turned in their identity cards rather than submit to this intimidation.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> French Wine Region Tax Strike\n\n![Painting: Marcelin Albert stands on rubble amidst a crowd of men, raising his right hand aloft and gesturing with the other hand.](../../../assets/marcelin-albert.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>Marcelin Albert leading the tax strike\u003C/figcaption>\n\nDuring the French wine region tax strike of 1907, the municipal governments of the area resigned \u003Ci>en masse\u003C/i>.\nTax strike leader Marcelin Albert claimed that “12,000 cities, towns, boroughs, and villages in the south of France” were left without municipal governments as a result of the resignations.\nA report noted:\n\n> The quitting of municipal officers is usually attended with much ceremony.\n> Generally a crape streamer is hoisted at the flagstaff, and the Mayor burns his official sash in public.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The Boekes\n\nWar tax resisters Beatrice and Cornelis Boeke felt that in order for their tax resistance to be consistent, they must also refuse to use state-run monopolies like the postal service and railways, relinquish their passports, stop contributing to retirement accounts, and renounce any claim to the protection of the police, courts, and military.\nWhen the government started providing funding even for private schools, they withdrew their children and home-schooled them.\nThey even stopped handling government-issued currency.\nThey took this so far that they abandoned their home rather than call the police when vagrants moved in.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Tasmania\n\nIn Tasmania, in 1874, 26 magistrates resigned their offices rather than try to enforce a widely-resisted tax.\n\n> Such an expressive demonstration on the part of gentlemen holding the commission of the peace incited the people to stronger resistance;

the census that Caesar Augustus had launched as part of his plan “that all the world should be taxed.”\n\nA government doesn’t launch a census just because it’s curious, but usually, as with Augustus, as the prelude to a tax.\nIt’s the government’s way of “casing the joint” before the big heist.\nSome tax resistance campaigns have decided that it’s best to begin resisting early by resisting such a census.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nRefusing to register was one way people resisted Thatcher’s poll tax.\nThe government had difficulty tracking people as they moved from place to place and from one council’s jurisdiction to another, and it sometimes couldn’t learn who the taxpayers were unless they volunteered to be counted.\n\nResisters also successfully refused to provide information about their employment that could be used to seize taxes from their paychecks.\nAccording to one account:\n\n> [T]he councils still had one insurmountable headache.\n> They had to find out where people worked.\n> This was a real nightmare because other than asking the people concerned, they had no real way of getting the information they needed.\n> When a liability order was granted by the court, non-payers were sent a form which requested details of employment.\n> Failure to fill it out carried a fine of £100 and £400 if the non-payer provided false information.\n> But this didn’t act as a deterrent either, because, if people couldn’t pay the Poll Tax itself (and the court costs which were added), then it made little difference if the council added another £100.\n> A survey carried out by the Audit Commission in late 1989 showed that, nationally, only 15% of people who received the form actually sent it back.\n> Like electoral registration, it was widely ignored even though this was a criminal offence.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Household Tax Resistance\n\n![licensed from William Murphy under a

community, it is a tax to fund private speculators, bondholders, and the bailout.\n> Our incomes and services are being decimated to pay this private debt.\n> Now people have a chance to register their opposition by not registering for this tax.\n> By not registering, we can make this a referendum on the bailouts for the rich and the cuts for us.\n\nOnly about half of Irish households had registered by the legal deadline at the end of March, 2012.\nRuth Coppinger of the Campaign Against Household and Water Taxes declared victory:\n\n> This is more than was achieved by Poll Tax non-payment which started off at 15% in the first year, 1989, and which only reached 45% boycott in the year of its abolition.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Episcopalians in Scotland\n\nThe official church of Scotland had a habit through the centuries of taxing everyone in Scotland for its support, even members of rival churches.\nThis annoyed people who preferred another denomination.\nAnd this annoyance became especially loud whenever the “official” church changed.\n\nWhen the Presbyterians succeeded the Episcopalians as the church of record in 1688, one way Episcopalians resisted was by refusing to pay the tax and refusing to participate in a church-run census.\nWilliam Maitland, in his \u003Ci>History of Edinburgh\u003C/i>, fretted over difficulties in estimating the population at this period of time, noting:\n\n> [T]he greatest Defect is owing to the Episcopalian Inhabitants, who, being of a different Communion from the established Church, are not subject to the Controul and Examination of its Ministers; wherefore, many of them refuse to give Accounts either of the Names or Numbers of Persons in their Familities.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Queensland Water Tax Strike\n\nIn Queensland, Australia, in 1926, the government tried to sneak a tax on farmers who used wells or water pumps to irrigate their lands.\nThe farmers rebelled.\n\nSince the tax took the form of a stiff fee that accompanied the mandatory registration of such wells or water pumps, it was natural that the tax resistance included mass refusal to register.\nLocal Producers’ Associations across Queensland gathered and voted to refuse registration.\n\nA month after the tax went into effect, facing this campaign of mass refusal, the government backed down and rescinded the tax… but it did not eliminate the requirement to register wells and water pumps, which was the pretext the tax had been hooked onto.\nSome Associations were suspicious, and continued to counsel their members to refuse to register even after their tax resistance victory.\nA Mr. Roome of the Woodmillar LPA put it this way:\n\n> A lot of farmers were under the impression that because [the] registration fee had been withdrawn, everything in the garden was lovely.\n> But the regulations were still there, and farmers who were under that impression would receive a rude awakening.\n> Only formal registration had to be made, but they would find that if they furnished the particulars asked for they would give the Government an opportunity to later on impose the charges.\n> The danger was still there, whereas if they refused to register the onus was on the Government to get the particulars, and prove that the farmers put down wells or sunk dams, etc.\n> Once they gave the information they were at the mercy of the Government.…\n> The excuse by the Government was that they wanted to get a survey of the water facilities which was absolutely ridiculous.\n> The whole thing was a farce, and an excuse to impose a tax.\n> The only way was to refuse to register, which he hoped would be done by members of all branches, and also refuse to pay the tax.\n\nThe Association passed a resolution encouraging its members to continue to refuse to register.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Boycotting “Count Days”\n\nIn the United States, school districts often get government funding based on how many students are in attendance on certain “count days.”\nThe more students are at school on those days, the more money the district can get from the various governments that provide school funding.\nDistricts do a lot to try to increase attendance on “count days” for this reason—stunts like bringing elephants to campus, giving away gift bags, holding ice cream socials, and hosting carnival rides at school.\nBut one parent, Carrie Klauber of Colorado, decided to use this as leverage, saying she would keep her children home from school on count days, and thereby deprive the district of money, to try to push her district to adopt better policies.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Census Resistance in Fiji\n\nFiji initiated a poll tax on indentured workers from India in 1924.\nThe Indians had no political representation on the island, were banned from the schools, and could only emigrate on a single ship voyage offered once per year: they were considered disposable migrant labor.\nThe workers thought that this new tax, which amounted to 12 days’ pay, was a bait-and-switch violation of the contracts that had brought them to Fiji, and so they vowed to resist.\nAs one account put it:\n\n> A start will be made in January to register all those liable to pay the residential tax, and prison will be the fate of him who does not comply with the law.\n> Leading Indians in every district declare that they will willingly go to gaol before they register their names, and a general passive resistance is highly possible, with all its attendant strikes and bitter feeling.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\n![The phrase “Votes For

suffrage movement in the United Kingdom, more so than anywhere else, used tax resistance in its struggle.\nSuffragists also resisted government attempts to get information from them, both because these attempts were part of the effort to tax them, and because the laws that governed such information-gathering had been passed by a male-exclusive government.\n\nIn 1910, Winifred Patch wrote:\n\n> I have recently received a paper from the Inland Revenue Office headed “Duties on Land Values. Notice to Furnish Information,” asking for the names and addresses of any persons to whom I pay rent or for whom I may collect rents, a penalty not exceeding £50 being incurred if this information is wilfully withheld.…\n> As I am denied the rights of citizenship I absolutely decline to facilitate in any way the carrying out of the provisions of Mr. Lloyd George’s Finance Bill, and am returning my paper with this written across it.\n> I am hoping, through the Women’s Tax Resistance League, of which I am a member, to obtain expert information which will enable me to make it impossible for the Government to exact the £50 penalty, and will leave them with no alternative but to imprison me in default.\n> Will other women join me in making this protest?\n> I feel that there must be many like myself who would gladly risk imprisonment for the cause, but who, for various reasons, find it very difficult, if not impossible, to take part in the more active protests which have hitherto brought women into conflict with the law.\n> I cannot help hoping that we have here another vantage ground from which to attack a Government which refuses us justice.\n\nTeresa Billington-Grieg took up Patch’s suggestion and rallied the troops:\n\n> The famous forms on which the owners and lease-holders of the country have to prepare the necessary statistics for the levying of the new [land] tax have been issued now in practically all parts of England, and they will be issued in Scotland within a few days.\n> Already these forms have been returned unfilled up, and with a curt comment as to the status of the women applied to, by some of our members in England.\n> They will be so returned by many Suffragists across the border.\n> Neither information nor money will be forthcoming in response to the Inland Revenue Department’s demands.\n> As far as possible this piece of Government business will be impeded first by the determined refusal of information, and, second, by the withholding of the money claimed in taxes.\n>\n> Such refusal to yield to tyranny is always desirable.\n> But at the present moment it carries an additional value in that it can be employed to improve the chances of the Conciliation Women’s Suffrage Bill.\n> From now until the fate of the Bill is decided, every woman to whom any Government application for information or for taxes is made should not only refuse to comply because of the unrepresented condition of her sex, but should add a rider to the effect that she will gladly supply information and provide the money claimed if the Women’s Suffrage Bill at present before Parliament becomes law this Session.\n\nMargarete Wynne Nevinson put it this way:\n\n> Here I have one of Mr. Lloyd George’s wonderful forms, with its numerous questions, to answer which intelligently I should require, apparently, the training of a lawyer and surveyor, and a fund of universal knowledge which I do not possess.\n> I am asked to answer those questions, but am not considered fit to vote for a member of Parliament.\n> This Form is addressed to me because I have a little freehold property, but it starts off with “Sir.”\n> I am sending it back, pointing our that I must be addressed as “Madam,” and not “Sir,” and that as I have not vote, I do not see what this matter has to do with me.\n> If you think of it, it is rather an insult to all women property holders to be addressed as “Sir,” and not by their proper title of courtesy.\n> The State seems to take for granted that there can be no free women or women freeholders in the country, but that all the land must be owned by men.\n\nThe following year, Charlotte Despard announced that this strategy of non-cooperation would be extended to the national census. One news account said:\n\n> The census would cost a great deal of money, said Mrs. Despard, and involve an enormous amount of labor.\n> So far as they were concerned, this census should not be taken.\n>\n> “We shall prove,” said Mrs. Despard, “whether there is a people, or whether there can be a people without the women.\n> We shall call upon women householders and women lodgers all over the country to refuse absolutely all information when the census takers come round.”\n>\n> Women, she went on, had been proud to belong to the nation, but they had been denied their citizenship.\n> Was it not logical, therefore, that they should say, “Very well; citizens we are not, and we shall not register ourselves as citizens?”\n> That was logical, as a protest should be, and it would be effective.\n>\n> Speaking of the preparations for the census, Mrs. Despard asserted that the officials were trying to get cheap labor: little girls from the schools at six and seven shillings a week.\n> Mrs. Despard added that the members were going to obstruct other Government business and make other protests, and they would stop the census boycott only when they had the promise of the Prime Minister that a Woman’s Suffrage Bill would be introduced this session.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* \u003Ci>Luke\u003C/i> chapter 2\n*

'@astrojs/starlight/components';\n\nYou can withhold resources from the government by making your economic transactions less easily traceable: for instance by using cash instead of checks, bank transfers, or credit cards.\n\nWhen you pay with cash, you make it easier for the recipient to evade taxes on the income or sale.\nAlthough the government can respond to this by raising the tax rate on the people it does catch in its net, that approach diminishes taxpayer morale and increases the financial incentive for evasion, which can make the government’s problem worse on the whole.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Greek Restaurants\n\nIn Greece, for example, restaurants and taverns will often simply tell patrons the amount of the bill rather than writing up a formal receipt.\nThen, if the patrons pay in cash, the businesses will pocket the money but never put the transaction on the books and never pay taxes on the earnings.\nThe government of Greece responded to this form of evasion by telling patrons that they are not obligated to pay a bill unless it comes in the form of a paper receipt—they could just walk out the door with a free lunch, legally.\nFortunately, the social norms against cheating people who feed you are pretty strong, and patrons so far seem more inclined to help assist tax evading businesses than to get government-approved freebies at their expense.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> United States\n\nAn anonymous ex-waiter in the United States explained one way you can help wait staff in that country to lower their taxes.\nWhen reporting tips to the government, he says, restaurants look at the tips reported on those receipts that were paid for by credit card to determine an average tip.\nThey then apply this average to all of the tables—cash and credit—that were served by a particular waiter:\n“They look at the charged meals, look at the number of total meals served, and then look at the charged tips to figure out how much cash tips you received.”\nHe suggests that when you pay by credit card, put a 1% tip on it and then pay the rest of the tip in cash, so as to skew the average.\n\nIt is difficult for governments to determine how much they lose because of their inability to tax cash transactions.\nAt one point the U.S. government estimated that only 68% of business income that can be off-the-books ever gets reported to the Internal Revenue Service—and that drops to less than 50% for sole proprietors.\nCertain categories of “informal suppliers” who work off-the-books on a cash basis are thought by the agency to declare only 20% of their income (and many of them, I suspect, declare the income in order to qualify for tax credits, rather than to subject themselves to income tax).\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Nikolas, Katarina “Greece attempts to tackle fraud: No receipt, no obligation to pay”

sales tax strike in Ontario in 1981, the accounting firm Deloitte Haskins and Sells Canada (an ancestor of today’s enormous Deloitte professional services firm) published a booklet that described several ways that people could legally avoid the sales tax.\nThese included “such tips as buying large children’s clothing for small-sized adults or buying baby skin care products as substitutes for adult versions” (products intended for children evidently being exempt from the tax).\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> War Tax Resisters\n\nIn 1973 a group of war tax resisters in Boston, Massachusetts, opened a tax consulting service called “Common Sense” that “drew on the expertise of trained tax accountants to provide two services: counseling for tax resisters and aid to anyone in preparing tax forms…\nClients often were poor or working-class people.\nMany were helped to avoid tax overpayments, and a large degree of friendly communication was established.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Volunteer Income Tax Assistance\n\nToday in the United States, about 40% of households pay no federal income tax, legally, because their incomes are sufficiently low or their deductions and credits are sufficiently high.\nSome tax resisters there successfully resist the income tax by deliberately joining this 40%—they learn how to take advantage of deductions and credits so that they can earn enough to support themselves without earning so much that the government wants its cut.\n\nAn Internal Revenue Service-sponsored program called “Volunteer Income Tax Assistance” enlists and trains volunteers to help people—typically people with low incomes—to fill out their income tax returns.\nThe great majority of returns filed through this program result in refunds rather than additional payments (at a ratio of about 15:1), so Americans who volunteer for this program can take money from the government and give it back to tax filers, entirely by-the-book.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> French Farmers\n\nFrench farmers in the 17th and 18th centuries used every legal trick they could discover (and several less-legal ones besides) to reduce or eliminate the tithes due on their crops.\nSome of their tricks included:\n\n* growing new varieties of crops that were not mentioned in the tithe laws\n* planting “gardens” or “orchards” or “meadows” that were legally tax-exempt although they were functionally equivalent to the taxed fields\n* taking advantage of the way tax assessors rounded-off their figures so as to maximize how much of their crops would be mathematically exempted\n* planting a small amount of a taxable crop in a field that was dominated by a non-taxable crop and then claiming the whole field as non-taxable\n\nThese legal (or sometimes \u003Cem>questionably\u003C/em> legal) strategies were very effective at lowering tax revenue well below what the government hoped for.\n“Loopholes are discovered and exploited, efforts are made to stem the loss of revenue, new evasions are devised, and so on—a cat-and-mouse game in which, most observers agree, the mouse generally outwitted the

their own salt in defiance of British taxed salt was revolutionary.\n> The power of the Salt March was that it became a massive campaign—there was something everyone could do.\n> Some packaged the salt, some sold it, all could refuse to buy the taxed salt and buy the alternative.\n\nThe British occupation government knew that this piddling little tax had big symbolic value and that resistance could cause big trouble.\nTo give you some idea of how concerned they were: at one point they hired hundreds of people to destroy natural salt deposits on a beach where Gandhi planned to try to gather salt in defiance of the monopoly.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Phone Tax Resistance\n\nThe American war tax resistance movement targeted the federal excise tax on telephone

resisting quickly and without having to fear terrible government reprisals.\nThe small amounts resisted also meant that government action against any particular resister would not be cost-effective

action by themselves that they would not find so frightening if they were to do it along with a large group of people.\n\nPeople may also be reluctant to resist because they feel that unless a large number of people resist, their own resistance would be practically ineffective.\nBy waiting for a critical mass, you help ensure such skeptical resisters that their resistance will be valuable.\n\nAlso, by waiting to resist until a critical mass of resisters is available, you may be more able to overwhelm your opponents’ defenses, and so your resistance may be more effective.\n\n##

tactic was particularly prominent in the American war tax resistance movement, which often conducted demonstrations and other outreach activities at post offices and IRS buildings on “tax day,” the day when annual income tax returns are due.\n\nWar tax resister Frida Berrigan explained the tactic this way:\n> On tax day, everybody’s scrambling to pay the government and feeling like their hard earned dollars are being sopped up and wishing that that money went to roads and to schools and to healthcare.\n> We were able to interject some information about where that money really goes—and to offer some alternatives… about how people can withdraw their own complicity.\n\nHere are some of the many examples of how war tax resisters used tax day as a creative outreach opportunity:\n\n* On tax day in 1966 Ken Knudson highlighted the connection between conscription and taxation by burning a check made out to the IRS while standing in front of the IRS office in Madison, Wisconsin, in much the same way as protesting conscripts were burning their draft registration cards.\n* Around tax day in 1982, war tax resister Ralph Dull filled his truck with 325 bushels of corn and delivered these to the IRS office in lieu of his tax payment.\n  He said that his unusual form of payment symbolized “the need for the United States government to balance the budget by not cutting human services but by reducing military spending by at least $100 billion.”\n* Two dozen war tax resisters in St. Louis, Missouri, propagandized taxpayers on tax day in 2003 by creating their own tax forms.\n  These featured a ghostly photo of an Iraqi child who had been wounded in the U.S. war on Iraq superimposed over the usual grid of an income tax form.\n  They placed these forms alongside the ones that taxpayers would pick up to fill out their returns.\n* The following year, I joined a group of war tax resisters in Oakland, California, and helped to enact a skit about taxes and war.\n  I played the part of an IRS agent and chided the crowd of protesters:\n  > “You seem like politically-savvy people.\n  > But do you realize that you wouldn’t have anything to protest here today if it weren’t for the things the government funds with your money?\n  > Your taxes make protests like this possible!\n  > You should thank us!… cluster bombs don’t grow on trees, barbed wire doesn’t grow on trees!\n  > It takes your money to make all this possible.\n  > We can’t do it without you! \u003Ci>We can’t do it without you!\u003C/i>”\n* In Portland, Oregon, war tax resisters held up a series of signs along the roadside that, in the fashion of [the old “Burma Shave” billboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma-Shave#Roadside_billboards), spelled out rhyming messages:\n  > $SIX BILLION A MONTH\u003Cbr/>AND DEATH EVERY DAY\u003Cbr/>DON’T LIKE THE WAR?\u003Cbr/>THEN REFUSE TO PAY\n  \n  > INSTEAD OF BOMBS\u003Cbr/>LET’S USE THE TAX\u003Cbr/>TO FEED MORE KIDS\u003Cbr/> OURS & IRAQ’S\n\n* In 2007, “The Occupation Project” in St. Louis, Missouri, displayed a series of “Caution” signs along the roadside.\n  The first read “Caution: War Tax Payment Zone.”\n  This was followed by one reading “Pause before you pay for…” and then a series of signs with messages like “House to House Searches,” “Torture,” “Hundreds of Thousands of Refugees,” “Over 3200 U.S. Military Dead,” and “Over 600,000 Iraqi Dead.”\n* War tax resisters in Biscay held a \u003Ci lang=\"es\">chorizada\u003C/i> (barbecue) in front of the executive government building during tax filing season in 2011, to protest the “\u003Ci lang=\"es\">chorizada\u003C/i>” (“swindle”) of military spending, passing out pieces of \u003Ci lang=\"es\">chorizo\u003C/i> (sausage) to passers-by while promoting war tax resistance and

that their members begin resisting, this can be a great boost to your campaign.\nHere are a few examples:\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Queensland’s LPAs\n\nAn existing network of “Local Producers’ Associations” was crucial to the mass-adoption of tax resistance by agriculturalists in Queensland, Australia, in 1927 and to the success of their tax resistance campaign.\nThe Associations used their preexisting communication and organizing infrastructure to call meetings, to create an information-sharing network across Queensland, and to coordinate policies.\nThis allowed them to put forward a bold and united tax resistance front so quickly and convincingly that their campaign succeeded in convincing the government to rescind its water tax after only a month.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nThe women’s suffrage movement in the United Kingdom was not unified.\nThere were tactical, ideological, and personal divides that fragmented the movement into several groups.\nThe Women’s Freedom League was an early adopter of the tactic of tax resistance, in 1908, and in 1909 it spun off a sub-group—the Women’s Tax Resistance League—devoted to that tactic.\nThis spin-off group tried to be ecumenical, accepting into its ranks activists from various factions, and trying in turn to spread the tactic of tax resistance to the various groups that made up the suffrage movement.\nThe gambit worked:\nIn 1910 they won the endorsement of the Women’s Social and Political Union, and in 1913 that of the Federated Council of Suffrage Societies.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Quakers\n\nSince the founding of the Society of Friends, it instructed members to refuse to pay government-mandated tithes to rival churches.\nThis policy soon extended to war tax resistance.\nQuakers were instructed not to pay taxes for “drums, colors, or for other warlike uses” and not to pay fines that the government assessed for their refusal to participate in the military.\n\nQuaker meetings would codify policies like these in a book of “discipline.”\nQuakers who deviated from these policies would be subject to a process of correction, or, if they continued to defy the policy, “disowning” (something akin to excommunication).\nHere is one example of a Quaker policy on war tax resistance, from the rules of discipline of the Rhode Island Yearly Meeting:\n\n> It is the concern of this meeting, to recommend to the several monthly meetings, that they, consistently with our ancient testimony, refuse the payment of all taxes, expressly or specially for the support of war, whether called for in money, provisions, or otherwise… and that such friends as do actively pay such taxes, be dealt with as disorderly walkers.\n\nSuch rules of discipline might change over time, and could differ from meeting to meeting.\nHeated argument might break out about how strict a standard of tax resistance Quakers should be held to.\nThis frequent debate helped to maintain awareness of tax resistance in the Society.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Peace Churches\n\nIn 1978 three American “peace church” denominations—Quakers, Brethren, and Mennonites—issued a rare joint statement that called for war tax resistance among their 350,000 church members, and asked their congregations to “uphold war tax resisters with spiritual, emotional, legal, and material support.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and

movement.\nSometimes such divisions spring from deliberate divide-and-conquer tactics by those who oppose the campaign.\nOther times they are simply fractures in an unstable coalition.\n\nIf a campaign can maintain and demonstrate solidarity in the face of such challenges, this can help it recruit and retain resisters.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> German Democrats\n\nIn mid-19th century Germany, the aristocracy tried to break a tax resistance movement by offering to moderate the government’s enforcement efforts against people who could show that they had limited means.\nKarl Marx, who promoted tax resistance at the time, saw this as a divide-and-conquer tactic and counseled people to disregard it:\n\n> The intention of the Ministry is only too clear.\n> It wants to divide the democrats; it wants to make the peasants and workers count themselves as non-payers owing to lack of means to pay, in order to split them from those not paying out of regard for legality, and thereby deprive the latter of the support of the former.\n> But this plan will fail; the people realizes that it is responsible for solidarity in the refusal to pay taxes, just as previously it was responsible for solidarity in payment of them.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nDuring the Bardoli tax strike, the government tried to exploit a variety of possible divisive wedges:\nSome villages in the district were relatively unharmed by recent tax increases, while others bore the brunt.\nEthnicity, religion, occupation, and caste were other possible dividing lines.\nThe government at times insisted that “outside agitators” were coming in from the nationalist movement to usurp the local struggle for their own ends.\n\nThere was also a divide in interests and risks between land-owners and the peasants who rented and worked the land:\n\n> The two sections of apparently conflicting interests were those who tilled the land and those who let it out.\n> The latter had great stakes, and unless they stood by the petty tenants, the struggle would fizzle out.\n\nStrike commander Vallabhbhai Patel visited these landlords and tried to convince them to maintain solidarity with the strike.\nHe told them that the government was blaming the recent tax hikes on the landlords’ rent increases which, by the government’s reasoning, demonstrated that the land had become more valuable and that a higher tax was justified:\n\n> The sole ground on which the assessment has been enhanced is the rise in the rental value of land, and whether that rise is real or unreal, you are responsible for it.\n> It is for your sins that the whole \u003Ci>taluka\u003C/i> [district] is suffering, and the least penance that you owe to them is to stand by them.\n> Will you be loyal to the \u003Ci>sarkar\u003C/i> [government] or to the tillers of the soil?\n> What is it that binds you to the \u003Ci>sarkar\u003C/i>?\n> Payment of taxation.\n> But what binds you to the peasants is a living bond.\n> It is their toil on which you live and carry on your trade.\n> If they are ruined, where will you be?\n> Do not be false to your mainstay.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca movement in Wales was very successful in its bold campaign, but it was weakened by tactics that alienated potential supporters.\n\nIn the Rebecca Riots, bands of disguised people, who followed leaders to whom they gave the pseudonym “Rebecca,” gathered in the dead of night to destroy toll booths all across Wales.\n\nBut the diffuse, non-hierarchical, anonymous structure of the movement made it vulnerable to people who wanted to hijack it for their own ends.\nPeople and groups calling themselves “Rebecca” began issuing threats and enacting vigilante justice in a variety of causes, or sometimes in what seemed like merely personal grievances.\n\nFor example, after Rebecca and her sisters came to the aid of farmers by reducing the tolls they were charged when bringing their goods to market, another meeting of Rebeccaites decided they were therefore justified in demanding that these newly-liberated farmers and merchants lower the prices of their goods.\nButter and beer would now be cheaper in Wales, and the Rebeccaites would see to it—by force if necessary.\n\nThings like this made the message of the movement confused, made it less sympathetic to potential supporters, and helped the authorities to recruit spies and people willing to testify against the rioters from among those who otherwise might have been their allies.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nWhen the Women’s Tax Resistance League and allied organizations were trying to win the vote for women, most men couldn’t vote either.\nThe right to vote was largely restricted to propertied men, though there were ongoing campaigns for universal male suffrage that hoped to change this.\n\nBecause much of the women’s movement at the time was trying to get women to be treated equally as voters under the law, it was, therefore, fighting merely for the voting rights of propertied women, not for women in general.\n\nMovement activist Dora Montefiore reflected on this, and the divisions it threatened to provoke:\n\n> …the Members of the Social Democratic Federation, of which I was a member, were very scornful because they said we should have been asking at that moment for Adult Suffrage and not Votes for Women; but although I have always been a staunch adult suffragist, I felt that at that moment the question of the enfranchisement of women was paramount, as we had to educate the public in our demands and in the reasons for our demands, and as we found that with many people the words “Adult Suffrage” connoted only manhood suffrage, our urgent duty was at that moment to gain Press publicity up and down the country and to popularise the idea of the political enfranchisement of women.\n>\n> I explained in all my speeches and writings that though it looked as if I were only asking for Suffrage for Women on a property qualification, I was doing this because the mass of non-qualified women could not demonstrate in the same way, and I was to that extent their spokeswoman.…\n> The working women from the East End came, time and again, to demonstrate in front of my barricaded house and understood this point and never swerved in their allegiance to our organisation.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Poll Tax Resistance\n\nIn the campaign against Thatcher’s poll tax there were frequent tensions between the locally-organized grassroots groups that were the real engine of the revolt and the professional left/labor radical groups and politicians who kept trying to put themselves at the front of the parade.\n\nWhen a number of people were arrested during an anti-poll tax demonstration at Trafalgar Square, some of the movement leadership distanced themselves from those who had been arrested—they wanted to distinguish nonviolent tax resisters from people who were charged with resisting arrest or other such charges.\nThey even went so far as to talk about holding “an internal inquiry” to “root out the troublemakers.”\nBut when the defendants in these cases organized their own collective defense committee, the leaders of the All-Britain Federation tried to appropriate their momentum by launching its own rival defense fund and soliciting donations (they failed).\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Left-Right Coalitions\n\nThere have been some attempts at coalition building between tax-sensitive activists on the left and right in the United States (where the folks at the top keep the folks at the bottom facing off against each other across the left-right divide so their pockets face outwards and are easier to pick).\n\nThe National Taxpayers Union held a “tea party” in 1970 at which right-leaning libertarians like Murray Rothbard and Karl Hess, and leftish war tax resisters like Bradford Lyttle spoke.\nThe following year, leftist scholar and war tax resister Noam Chomsky and conservative publisher Robert Kephart shared the stage at a National Taxpayers Union event.\n\n\u003Chr

the time” action.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Poll Tax Resistance\n\nThe rebellion against Thatcher’s poll tax used a number of creative face-to-face outreach strategies:\n\n* The Aberdeen chapter of the campaign enlisted a local theater group to create a performance about the poll tax.\n  They put on shows in neighborhoods, and afterwards held meetings at which they explained how to resist registration and how to set up support groups.\n* Another group went door-to-door distributing a poster that people could put up in their windows that read “No Poll Tax Here.”\n  They then waited to see which households displayed the posters, and then made a second visit to those homes, recruiting enough committed activists this way to form the core of a local group.\n* A film crew shot footage for a documentary about the poll tax rebels in Easton.\n  This became an opportunity for more face-to-face contact among potential activists.\n  Campaign historian Danny Burns recalls:\n  > The film was never shown, but the way the community was engaged in the process of making it is instructive.\n  > The film producers wanted a shot of all the doors in the street, opening one by one as the occupants came out of their houses with banners and signs.\n  > Charles, the local street rep, went round to people’s houses every evening for a week and explained to them what was wanted.\n  > Out of 30 houses in the street (a cul-de-sac) 28 agreed to participate.\n  > The street is multi-racial with a fairly wide class mix.\n  > It was inspiring to see white working class men standing shoulder to shoulder with Asian women and their kids, holding the same banners and engrossed in conversation.\n  > Some of them had never spoken to each other before.\n  > The film was made, but more importantly, as [a] result of making it, virtually every one of those households joined the Union, and most still had posters in their windows a year later.\n  > People were brought into the campaign, not through a leaflet or a canvasser, but through an interesting activity.\n  > They didn’t have to go to the campaign, it came to them.\n\nBoth the poll tax resistance campaign and the later Dublin water charge strikers used door-to-door surveys to good effect as well.\n\n\u003CAside type=\"tip\" title=\"See also\">\n[Conduct Surveys to Gauge

women’s suffrage activist Marie Lawson launched what she called a “snowball” protest:\na sort of [chain letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_letter) in which she sent out letters that advocated tax resistance (and that protested on behalf of an imprisoned resister) and that asked the recipients to send the same letter “to at least three friends.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> U.S. Military Aid Foes\n\nWhen the United States approved a billion-dollar military aid package to the government of Colombia in 2000, the president of the Mennonite Church of Colombia, Peter Stucky, and Ricardo Esquivia, the director of that church’s Justapaz organization and the coordinator of the Evangelical Council of Colombia’s Human Rights and Peace Commission, wrote a letter to their sister churches in the United States.\n\nIn that letter, they explained the disastrous consequences of fueling the civil war and the military wing of the war on drugs in Colombia, and they told how the church there was trying to respond more productively to the crisis.\nThey called on American churches to do their part:\n\n> In reality, the government of the United States, using the taxpayers’ money, is supporting the Colombian government in what we consider to be a negative form.\n> This means that the message arriving from the North to the Colombian people becomes a message of death and destruction.\n> For that reason we are calling the churches in the North to redeem their taxes, on one hand by demanding that the U.S. government invests this money in life-producing projects, and on the other hand by redirecting part of their taxes toward a different project in your community or the world that promotes abundant and dignified life, as our Lord Jesus Christ has commanded us.\n\nThe American Mennonite Central Committee responded by urging taxpayers to redirect their taxes to the Mennonite-run “Taxes for Peace” fund, which was dedicated that year to peace-building efforts in Colombia.\n\n\u003CAside type=\"tip\" title=\"See also\">\n[Redirect Resisted Taxes to

can be dangerous.\nIn 1918, R.W. Benner, an American Mennonite minister, got worried reports from members of his congregation who were being told in no uncertain terms that they would buy so-called “Liberty Bonds” to support the U.S. war effort, or they would answer for their refusal.\nBenner wrote for advice to his bishop, L.J. Heatwole, who responded by reiterating the position of the church:\n“Do not aid or abet war in any form…\nContribute nothing to a fund that is used to run the war machine.”\nHe noted:\n\n> In a number of places where brethren have refused to contribute to the different war funds, outlandish threats have been made and in a few cases have been put into execution—such as, tar and feathering, painting houses yellow, decorating autos and buildings with flags to test them out on their principles of nonresistance.\n\nHeatwole urged his fellow-Mennonites to keep the faith and to embrace this sort of martyrdom like good Christians.\nBenner passed this message along to his flock.\nFor this, both of them were criminally convicted under the Espionage Act.\n(To give you some idea of the railroading involved, Heatwole did not learn that a guilty plea had been submitted on his behalf by “his” court-appointed attorney until after he appeared for the trial!)\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Quakers\n\nLetters, or “epistles,” from tax resisting Quakers to their fellow-Friends were an important way of spreading and maintaining tax resistance in their Society.\n\nIn 1755 the Quaker-dominated Pennsylvania Assembly granted money in response to a request from the crown for funds to help England fight the Seven Years’ War (and its American theater: the French and Indian War).\nThe Assembly decided to raise this money by taxing Pennsylvania colonists.\nAmerican Quakers were of mixed opinions about a tax like this—since the tax was to fund a grant that was vaguely “for the King’s use” was it really a \u003Cem>war\u003C/em> tax that Quakers were obligated to resist, or might the money plausibly be spent on any of a variety of the kingdom’s expenses, in which case it should not bother a Quaker to “render unto Caesar”?\n\nJohn Woolman, Anthony Benezet, and several other Quakers addressed a letter to other Friends in which they explained:\n\n> [B]eing painfully apprehensive that the large sum granted by the late Act of Assembly for the king’s use is principally intended for purposes inconsistent with our peaceable testimony, we therefore think that as we cannot be concerned in wars and fightings, so neither ought we to contribute thereto by paying the tax directed by the said Act, though suffering be the consequence of our refusal, which we hope to be enabled to bear with patience.\n\nThis letter put some meat on the bones of the Quaker peace testimony.\nIt would no longer be enough just to look at the form a tax took, or what the legislature chose to call it, but instead a conscientious Quaker would need to ask with genuine curiosity to what ends the tax money would be spent and whether these ends would be consistent with Quaker teachings.\n\nJoseph Whitall reflected on how thoughtful letters like these helped him maintain his war tax resistance in times of doubt:\n\n> I read with singular satisfaction the piece which you lent me respecting taxes, as it was very strengthening to my mind, which before was somewhat encompassed with weakness on this account.…\n> I have since felt much weakness, and had come to no solid conclusion of mind, until I read your little manuscript, which caused my heart to rejoice, under a feeling sense that it is the truth which leads those who walk and abide in it to hold forth this testimony unto the world.\n> And oh, says my soul, that I may yield faithful obedience to its monitions, let what will be the consequence.\n\n## Lessons from the American War Tax Resistance Movement\n\nA well-crafted and timely personal message can make all the difference in motivating anti-war activists to become war tax resisters.\nI’ve spent some time investigating how the American war tax resistance movement might craft a more persuasive face-to-face recruitment message.\nSome of my conclusions would be valid for (or have analogies in) a variety of tax resistance campaigns.\n\nAs in sports, there’s an offensive game and a defensive game:\nOffense is knowing what message you want to convey, crafting it well, and deploying it effectively.\nDefense is anticipating questions, understanding the real concerns behind them, having good answers ready, and not getting thrown off-message.\n\n### Playing Offense\n\nTo craft a motivating message, consider three categories of motivations: \u003Cem>needs\u003C/em>, \u003Cem>fears\u003C/em>, and \u003Cem>values\u003C/em>.\nTo motivate somebody to do something, show them how it will meet their needs (or not interfere with getting their needs met), protect them from something they fear (or not expose them to something frightening), and promote their values (or not require them to violate these values).\n\nWhen the government tries to motivate taxpayers, they rely on fears and values.\nFears of tax audits, criminal penalties, financial troubles, and so forth are important in shaping taxpayer compliance.\nBut it turns out that values are even more important.\n\nIn 2012 the IRS Oversight Board surveyed American taxpayers to ask them which factors were important to them when they decided whether to report their income and pay their taxes.\n40% said that fear of an audit was a very important influence on this decision.\nBut \u003Cem>86%\u003C/em> said “personal integrity” was very important (only 4% said integrity was not very or not at all important).\n\nMost American taxpayers pay taxes because they identify taxpaying with honesty, fairness, good citizenship, and their values as a whole.\n\nWar tax resisters offer another path to integrity.\nThe more they speak about how their values motivate them to become tax resisters, the easier it is for people who share those values to imagine themselves as tax resisters.\n\nBut fear is also important.\nWhen the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee surveyed 1,106 anti-war activists who had never done tax resistance before, the #1 reason they gave for why they hadn’t was “Fear legal consequences.”\nAsked what they thought were the two most likely consequences of war tax resistance, 31.6% included jail time (which in reality is extremely rare).\nAsked what they needed most before they would consider resisting, the #1 answer was “Clear idea of likely consequences.”\n\nPeople imagine the consequences of war tax resistance to be much more frightening than they really are.\nThe war tax resistance movement should dispel this myth, not by saying “tax resistance is perfectly safe” but this:\n\n* There are many methods of war tax resistance, with different levels and types of risk.\n* You can learn the risks in advance and take steps to mitigate them.\n* If you take these steps the risks are much smaller than you might expect.\n* Hardly anyone goes to jail for war tax resistance.\n\nWar tax resisters can also appeal to needs.\nAnti-war activists commonly say they’re tired of going to rallies and marches—they want to do something concrete that has a real, direct effect.\nTax resistance meets this need.\n\n### Playing Defense\n\nWhen you’re playing defense, you’ll find that some questions come up frequently when tax resistance is discussed.\nThese also concern needs, fears, and values:\n\nIs tax resistance *effective?* (needs)\n: For instance: “Won’t the government just end up with more money after they add interest and penalties to the tax I resist?” or “How can one person’s refusal make a difference to the vast government budget?”\n\nIs tax resistance *safe?* (fears)\n: For instance: “Won’t they lock me up or take my home if I refuse taxes?” or “If activists resist taxes, won’t the government use this as an excuse to crack down on dissent?”\n\nIs tax resistance *ethical?* (values)\n: For instance: “Don’t we all need to pay our fair share?” or “Is it fair for me to decide where a democracy spends my taxes?”\n\nWhen you answer questions like these, address both the specific question or concern and the whole category it represents.\nFor instance, you might answer a specific question about the ethics of tax resistance, and then add something about how your \u003Cem>values\u003C/em> led you to become a tax resister.\n\nYou can meet a question honestly in many ways.\nSometimes, a direct answer is best.\nOther times, it’s better to put the question into a larger context or to address the assumptions behind the question.\nIt can pay to practice meeting common questions in multiple ways.\n\nWith some questions the best policy is to change the subject.\nIf you’re about to begin an answer that is likely to end with a defense of some particular political philosophy, what Jesus really meant, or the real truth about the JFK assassination—take a deep breath and start over.\n\nFor example, if someone asks, “do you think everybody should be able to decide on their own what their tax money can be spent on?” you could answer, “Yes: As a free-market anarchist, I think a society in which people make their own decisions about how to spend their money would be a big improvement,” but pretty soon you’re defending anarchism and not tax resistance, and maybe you’re giving the impression that tax resistance is only for eccentric anarchists.\n\nThe question had a couple of purposes: The first was \u003Cem>to express a concern\u003C/em> about whether tax resistance is an ethical thing to do.\nThe second is more subtle, but involves the questioner \u003Cem>searching for an excuse\u003C/em> not to become a tax resister.\nThe questioner hopes to show that you hold some particular dogma (anarchism, pacifism, whatever), that adhering to this dogma is an essential part of being a tax resister, and that therefore the questioner doesn’t have to consider becoming a resister anymore since he or she doesn’t hold such views.\n\nBut you don’t have to cooperate.\nYou could answer something like this instead:\n“Maybe so and maybe not, but the war tax resisters I know spend their money more fairly and wisely than Congress does.\nIf war tax resisters were budgeting more money and Congress less, we’d all breathe easier.\nBy taking responsibility for how my money is spent, I make sure Congress doesn’t spend it irresponsibly.”\n\nComparisons are one good way to put things into context:\n\n* “As protesters we are sometimes willing to be arrested doing sit-ins and blockades, and we risk jail time and fines for civil disobedience.\n  Why should we think the much smaller risks of tax resistance are so scary?”\n* “People will pay double-digit interest on their credit cards to pay for Christmas presents.\n  I think I can risk a few percentage points of interest and penalties to fight for what I think is right.”\n* “We want politicians to take political risks by cutting off funding for the war.\n  I want to show that I’m willing to take risks to cut off my funding too.”\n\nWhen you play defense, look for opportunities to get back on offense—especially when you’re trying to get your message out through the news media.\nOn such occasions, don’t be afraid to take charge.\nPut your message front-and-center.\nHelp meet the reporter’s needs with pithy, well-practiced sound bites.\nIf it’s a telephone interview, write some key phrases down ahead of time so you can be ready when the right moment comes.\n\n\u003CAside

benefits of community and society.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nSocial boycott was an important tool of the Bardoli tax refusal campaign during the independence struggle in India.\nMahadev Desai, in \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i>, writes:\n\n![Vallabhbhai Patel seated behind a desk, gesturing with his hand](../../../assets/vallabhbhai-patel.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>Vallabhbhai Patel\u003C/figcaption>\n\n> It is this weapon that exasperated the Government, but they were helpless because social boycott was no offence under the Penal Code.\n> And the \u003Ci>Sardar\u003C/i> [Vallabhbhai Patel, who commanded the campaign] poured ridicule on Government for grudging the people the use of this their only weapon.\n> “What do you do yourselves?\n> Yours is a close corporation maintained by force of arms and its motive is no nobler than keeping a nation in bondage.\n> We resort to this weapon simply for the sake of self-defence and self-preservation.”\n> But he never omitted to emphasize its limitations, the very first being that in no circumstances should a Satyagrahi refuse to minister to the physical needs of the party boycotted.\n> “Eschew by all means molestation or oppression.\n> We may not refuse anyone milk, water, foodstuffs, help in case of illness or worse.\n> We cannot afford to prosecute boycott at the expense of our humanity.”\n\nAmong the ways the Bardoli strikers boycotted landowners who paid property taxes was to refuse to rent their fields or to work as agricultural laborers for them.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> American Revolution\n\nDuring the American revolution, boycotts of British imports were enforced by social boycott.\nOne resolution of boycotters read:\n\n> [W]e will not purchase any goods of any persons who, preferring their own interest to that of the public, shall import merchandise from Great Britain, until a general importation takes place; or of any trader who purchases his goods of such importer: and… we will hold no intercourse, or connection, or correspondence, with any person who shall purchase goods of such importer, or retailer; and we will hold him dishonored, an enemy to the liberties of his country, and infamous, who shall break this agreement.\n\nAnother said:\n\n> [W]hoever shall… in any wise aid or abet in unloading, receiving, or vending the tea sent or to be sent out by the East India Company while it remains subject to the payment of a duty here is an enemy to America—\n> …That a Committee be immediately chosen to wait on those Gentlemen, who it is reported are appointed by the East India Company to receive and sell said tea, and to request them from a regard to their own characters and the peace and good order of this town and province immediately to resign their appointment.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The Anti-Pizzo Movement\n\nSicily’s branch of the Confindustria industrialists’ union unanimously voted in 2007 to expel any member who was caught paying protection money (the most primitive variety of tax) to the mafia, and a few dozen members were in fact expelled from the group under this policy.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Quakers\n\nMany Quaker meetings had a policy of “disowning” members who failed to practice war tax resistance or tithe resistance.\nSometimes, even failing to report that the government had subjected you to “sufferings” for your resistance could make you suspect.\nIf Quakers failed to report anything of this sort, others might visit them and ask how they had managed to avoid government reprisals while maintaining their refusal to pay.\n\nDisowning was something like excommunication.\nIt withheld the benefits of meeting membership from the disobedient Quakers until such time as they repented and made satisfactory amends—which might include publicly admitting the wrong of their behavior at a future meeting.\nOccasionally, as during the American Revolution, disownings like these might lead to schisms and the emergence of rival meetings with different policies.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The Tithe War\n\nDuring the Tithe War in Ireland, according to one report:\n\n> [P]ersons accused of the crime of tithe-paying are summoned to appear and give an account of their conduct, and defaulters undergo the punishment of being abandoned at once by every person in their employment.\n> Country gentlemen and farmers are left without a servant or labourer to perform the most necessary work.\n> The hay is left to rot on the ground, and the cattle to perish for want of the necessary food, drink, and care; and even on the roads it is common for the horses of the mails and stage-coaches to be changed by the coachmen and passengers, because the unhappy recusant innkeeper has been deserted by every one, even to his hostler.\n\nAnother report complained:\n“The people of Ireland have now virtually abolished tithes.\nThey will neither pay the tax themselves, nor have any dealings or intercourse with those who do…\nThe man who in any way upholds the obnoxious system, whatever his previous character or services may have been, is branded as an object of universal execration.”\n\n## \u003CBadge

Pennsylvania suddenly found themselves taxable in the wake of the success of the women’s suffrage movement.\nBut then they also became subject to strong social pressure to resist these new

activists who were \u003Cem>not\u003C/em> tax resisters.\nOne question they asked was: “Which resources would help you decide to participate [in a tax resistance campaign]?”\nThe most popular answer was: “clear idea of likely consequences.”\n\nThe two top responses to a question about “the most important reason you have not done war tax resistance” were “fear legal consequences” and “need more information.”\n\nPeople are comfortable with the familiar.\nIf you ask them to leap into the unknown, they will imagine the worst possible consequences to justify their reticence.\nIf you can be clear, thorough, and credible in demonstrating how to resist and what the consequences are likely to be, you can eliminate a big obstacle to the growth of your campaign.\n\n![How to Resist Collection (or make the most of collection when it occurs)](../../../assets/practical-3.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>the cover of one of NWTRCC’s “practical war tax resistance” pamphlets\u003C/figcaption>\n\nThis is easier said than done, however.\nIt can be difficult to be clear and thorough about consequences if you are confronting a tax agency that is arbitrary or that changes its processes unpredictably.\nAnd it can take time to establish credibility.\n\nNWTRCC publishes a number of specialized how-to pamphlets that cover various methods of tax resistance (such as [refusing to

for coping with possible consequences (such as [government collection efforts](https://nwtrcc.org/PDFs/practical3.pdf)).\n\nNWTRCC also organizes a nationwide [network of volunteers](https://nwtrcc.org/resist/contacts-counselors/) who offer one-on-one counseling sessions for potential resisters or for current resisters who are running into snags.\nThe national office keeps abreast of changes in the tax law and in IRS enforcement trends, and sends out bulletins and holds periodic counselor training sessions to keep the network up-to-date.\n\nLocal groups in NWTRCC also conduct workshops at which people can learn about the variety of war tax resistance methods and ask questions of people who have experience with them.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nEthel Ayres Purdie ran what she called the “Women Taxpayers’ Agency.”\nShe counseled British women’s suffrage activists on how best to resist their taxes on “no taxation without representation” grounds and how they could exploit legal quirks to legally avoid taxes.\n\nMembers of the Women’s Tax Resistance League regularly gave lectures on their tactics of choice at suffragist meetings, and recruited new resisters at these lectures.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nPeople who resisted Thatcher’s poll tax gained confidence thanks to the efforts of the Poll Tax Legal Group which, among other things, “produced over 30 accessible legal bulletins on the Poll Tax and a book called \u003Ci>To Pay or Not To Pay\u003C/i>.”\n\nTo combat the threat of property seizure (sometimes the threat itself could intimidate people into stopping their resistance) the movement educated the public about the seizure process and about ways to frustrate it:\n\n> [T]he first task of Anti-Poll Tax Unions was to inform people about what the bailiffs could and couldn’t do.\n> In Scotland, people were advised not to tell the sheriffs where they worked, not to tell them which banks they used, and not, under any circumstances, to let them into their houses.\n> They were also told to inform the local group as soon as the sheriffs threatened anything.\n> The Anti-Poll Tax Unions advised people to move possessions to local friends’ houses before the date of the poinding and offered to help with the moving.\n> People were told to leave their cars well away from their homes.\n> They were informed that a wrongful poinding could be appealed against and, in many cases, this was done successfully.\n> People were also told how to avoid bailiff action by signing away their possessions to people who lived outside of the area or, preferably, to their children.\n> There are now young children who technically own all of their parents’ possessions.\n>\n> Some local law centres went onto the offensive against the bailiffs, providing information to the public which totally undermined their actions.\n> One morning in May 1991, the bailiffs delivered over 4,000 intimidation notices to people throughout Bristol.\n> By 7:30 a.m. the law centre had heard about this and contacted all local radio stations.\n> By 8:00 p.m. the news bulletins which went out every fifteen minutes, reported:\n> > Today bailiffs have delivered notices for payment to over 4,000 people in Bristol.\n> > A

Here is one example:\n\n> In taking a survey of the troops under my direction in the late expedition against that insolent exciseman, John Neville, I find there were a great many delinquents, even

Hampden\n\nIn 1637, John Hampden refused to pay a new property tax that King Charles I had instituted without the consent of the English parliament.\nHis resistance succeeded at prompting the legal reform he sought.\n\nAt first he lost his legal battle, and was convicted by a slim majority of the judges who heard his case.\nBut he successfully proved his point in the court of public opinion:\n> [H]e grew the argument of all tongues, every man enquiring who, and what he was, that durst, at his own charge, support the liberty and property of the kingdom, and rescue his country, as he thought, from being made a prey to the court.\n\nThe next parliament formally legalized his resistance by voiding the “ship money” tax and declaring that both the tax and the court judgement against Hampden “were and are contrary to and against the laws and statutes of this realm.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> American Amish\n\nThe resistance and conscientious objection of Amish people to a social insurance tax forced the U.S. government to change its tax laws.\n\nSome Amish felt that government-sponsored social insurance programs were both mistrustful of God and destructive to the mutual support that is so important to Amish community.\nWhen the Social Security program and its social insurance tax became mandatory, many refused to pay the tax and refused to apply for benefits.\n14,000 signed a petition to Congress asking for permission to opt out of the program.\n\n\u003CAside type=\"tip\" title=\"See also\">\n[Petition for Redress of

accounts.\nAmish resisters responded by closing their accounts entirely.\nThe IRS then began to seize money from the cooperatives that purchased the resisters’ products, and then finally to seize the resisters’ property.\nThe regional IRS Chief of Collections said:\n“People have no right to use their religion as an excuse not to pay taxes.”\n\nAfter a number of resisters had been subjected to property seizures by the IRS—in one case they seized a man’s horses as he was using them to plow his field—public outrage and Amish petitioning finally convinced Congress to grant the Amish an exemption from the Social Security system and to cancel the outstanding tax bills of 15,000 resisters.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> “Peace Tax” Plans\n\nA number of pacifist groups, often including war tax resisters, have tried to get governments to recognize or legally formalize a right to conscientious objection to military spending.\nThey want conscientious objectors to be able to pay their taxes without paying for the military portion of the government’s budget: to pay a “Peace Tax.”\n\nSo far, none of these long-standing efforts—which have included persistent lobbying of legislators, as well as legal challenges using a variety of arguments and in a range of national and international judicial fora—have borne much fruit.\nGovernments seem universally unwelcoming to the idea, and those international legal bodies with any clout have not yet been convinced that this alleged “right” deserves recognition.\n\nMany conscientious objectors are themselves skeptical of Peace Tax plans, and feel that they would no more be able to conscientiously pay into a government-administered “Peace Tax Fund” than into the rest of the government’s budget.\n\nOne challenge for Peace Tax promoters is that it is difficult to separate a government’s military budget from the rest of its budget in a way that would make a genuinely separate Peace Tax plausible.\nThe Peace Tax legislation currently being promoted in the U.S., for instance, would ironically result in \u003Cem>more\u003C/em> taxpayer money going to military projects, simply because it is easy for the government to shift money from place to place.\n\nGovernments cannot be trusted to implement schemes like these in a way that respects the intentions of those who would use them.\nHere is one particularly egregious example:\nItaly has a tax called the \u003Ci>otto per mille\u003C/i> (8‰).\nTaxpayers can ask the government either to turn their contributions to this tax over to the taxpayer’s church of choice as a tithe or to spend it on “humanitarian and cultural projects” of the government’s choosing.\nIn some respects, this resembles the sort of plan that Peace Tax promoters have in mind.\nBut Italy’s government cunningly declared its participation in the Iraq War to be a “humanitarian and cultural” project and siphoned the \u003Ci>otto per mille\u003C/i> funds off that way.\nMore recently they used that money for such “humanitarian and cultural projects” as prison construction.\n\nSome Peace Tax proposals try to solve this problem by taking the Peace Tax money out of the ordinary government budget and turning it over instead to some more-or-less independent body that has an explicit mandate to spend the money in ways that do not stain the consciences of its contributors.\nWhile plans like this are more attractive to conscientious objectors, they are much less so to the governments that would have to sign off on them.\n\nSome activists in Norway are trying to make it easy for the government to create a Peace Tax, by doing the hard work for it.\nThey run a charity they call the \u003Ci>Norges Fredsfond\u003C/i> (Norwegian Peace Fund) and ask taxpayers to donate to it.\nWhen that fund reaches a critical mass of contributors it will gain legal tax-exempt status, and each dollar that people donate to it will reduce their taxes at their marginal tax rate (typically 28%, which means that—at least from one way of looking at it—a conscientious objector could offset his or her “war tax” by contributing about three times its amount to the fund).\n\nThe \u003Ci>Norges Fredsfond\u003C/i> is designed to resemble as much as possible a government-run peace tax fund that accepts tax money to be spent by the government on peace-promoting projects.\nThe organizers hope that by laying the groundwork of creating and administering such a fund, they will be better able to convince the government to legalize conscientious objection to military taxation and to absorb the fund into the government as the lawful alternative fund for conscientious objectors to pay their taxes into.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Examples\" size=\"medium\" /> Informal Legalization via Government Neglect\n\nA government may essentially concede simply by not trying to collect a tax or by not retaliating against resisters.\n\nColonial American Quaker war tax resister Joshua Evans was so persistent that eventually the tax collector surrendered.\n> I was told it was concluded that as I gave myself up very much to the service of Truth, it was not proper I should be troubled on account of military demands; and I understood my name was erased, or taken from their list.\n\nAmerican women’s suffrage activist Sarah E. Wall resisted her taxes for 25 years, when finally, according to Susan B. Anthony, “the assessor has left her name off the tax-list, and passed her by rather than have a lawsuit with her.”\nEnglish suffragist tax resister Charlotte Despard and some others also made themselves too troublesome to bother with:\n“[T]he Government rather than go to the trouble of selling up the recalcitrant ‘debtor,’ and attracting attention to the principle involved, had quietly dropped the matter in several instances.\nMrs. Despard had had no application for taxes since she had been sold up last year.”\n\nOccasionally something similar happens today, when because a tax resister has so few assets, or those assets would take too much trouble to discover, the Internal Revenue Service marks the resister’s file as “uncollectible” and gives up the attempt to force payment.\nAfter ten years, a delinquent income tax payment falls under a statute of limitations and the U.S. government is generally forbidden to pursue the matter further.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Conceding Without Conceding the Point\n\nWhen farmers in drought-ravaged regions of Argentina threatened a tax strike in 2009, the government responded with a clever bit of ju-jitsu:\nIt declared an agricultural emergency in the area.\nThis legally exempted those farmers from paying taxes.\nIn this way the government saved face by neither acknowledging defeat nor having to pursue the resisters.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Association of Real Estate Taxpayers\n\nProperty tax resisters in Depression-era Chicago won their concessions in court.\nA judge ruled that property assessments in the city had been performed incorrectly—$15 billion in property held by wealthy, well-connected Chicagoans had been somehow left off the rolls.\nWhen they won their case, their tax resistance was effectively legalized and the government was forced to cease its attempts to collect back taxes from the resisters.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Irish Land League\n\nThe Irish National Land League proved that the pressure of a rent strike can work on landlords in the same way a tax strike can work on governments.\nDuring the rent strike, Charles Stewart Parnell reported that “a large majority of landlords” reduced the rents on their properties.\n\n> The action of such a large majority of landlords, in reducing their rents, \u003Cem>after\u003C/em> the League had been formed, and the system of passive resistance fairly established, shows that they did finally recognize the situation, and that they determined to make the best of it.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Examples\" size=\"medium\" /> Prussia and Russia\n\nSometimes tax resistance is “legalized” by means of a conflict between rival governments or branches of government.\nFor instance, when the Prussian quasi-autocracy tried to ignore the legislature and govern on its own in 1848, the National Assembly formally declared tax resistance to be legal, and said that the autocrats had no authority to raise or spend money.\n\nSomething similar happened in Russia half a century later, when the Czar dissolved the Duma, which then reconvened in Vyborg, Finland and called on the citizens to refuse to pay any more taxes to the Czar.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Examples\" size=\"medium\" /> Governments Cannot Be Trusted\n\nBeware of trusting the government when it responds to your tax resistance campaign by insisting that it’s on your side and wants to help, or that you’ve made your point and they promise to change.\nThis is a very common gambit and often just means they hope you’ll give up and go away or get distracted by something else before they have to make good on their promise.\n\nWhen tax resistance leader Wat Tyler was assassinated while he was negotiating with the king in 1379, the king boldly went out to the enraged crowd and stunned them by telling them that from now on \u003Cem>he\u003C/em> would be their leader and would personally see to it that their demands were enacted.\nInstead, he waited for the fuss to die down, then executed some of the other leaders of the rebellion:\n“The low people were reduced to the same slavish condition as before, and several of the ringleaders were punished with capital severity.”\n\nWhen the Whigs were whisked into power in the wake of the Reform Act agitation around 1832, the tax resistance movement celebrated its victory… only to find that the Whigs could be just as tyrannical as their Tory cousins about prosecuting those who promoted tax resistance.\nIn 1834, a prosecution was brought against the proprietor of \u003Ci>The True Sun\u003C/i> for publishing “malicious and seditious libels, in which the people of this country were called upon to resist the payment of the assessed taxes.”\n\nDuring the Annuity Tax strike in Edinburgh, the government tried to mollify the resisters by passing something it called the “Edinburgh Annuity Tax Abolition Act.”\nAbolishing the annuity tax was exactly what the tax resisters wanted, but, despite its name, that act did not abolish the annuity tax at all, but merely concealed it by wrapping it in with another tax under another name.\nThe resisters were not fooled, and the resistance continued.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Providing more money for war sounds like exactly the opposite of what the National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund intends with the legislation it is promoting.\n  But sometimes good intentions lead to counterproductive laws and policies, and this is one example.\n  They acknowledge that the bill would increase government revenue without decreasing how much Congress could spend on war:\n\n  First, they admit that if the bill were to pass “The government would receive more revenue from increased participation in the payment of income taxes and would spend less on the cost of forced collections.”\n  They also say, of those who pay into the PTF, “nor will their participation in the Peace Tax Fund directly decrease the amount of money spent on war [as] this would violate the Constitutionally given powers of Congress to determine spending priorities.”\n  So Congress would have more taxpayer money than before and could spend as much as it wants on war.\n\n  Sources: “Your

recovering it.\n  The remaining 37% is divided into a “collectible” portion (8.5%) and an “uncollectible” portion (28.5%).\n  [“Financial Audit: IRS’s Fiscal Years 2006 and 2005 Financial Statements”

resistance campaigns, it seems obvious: perhaps it is the abolition of an odious tax, or the overthrow of the government, or the recognition of the rights of the disenfranchised, or a particular change in state policy.\nBut in some cases it is not so obvious, and in other cases the obvious answer isn’t necessarily the best one.\nThere are even campaigns in which the resisters don’t seem to have given much thought to victory at all—as though they were resigned to being a perpetual opposition movement.\n\nFor some campaigns, there is a precise change of government policy that is the goal of the movement (such as passage of the Reform Act or granting votes to women).\nBut if your campaign is trying to defeat the tax itself, you may want to consider a variety of possible paths to that goal, each of which will require a somewhat different strategy.\nIt can be helpful to imagine a variety of scenarios of victory in your campaign.\nBy keeping your eyes on your destination, you can be more confident that you’re travelling in the right direction.\n\nIn this chapter I discuss three common varieties of victorious end-game scenarios for such tax resistance campaigns:\n\n[Convince the government to rescind the tax or to legalize resistance.](../convincegovernmenttorescindtax/)\n: In this scenario, the government either formally repeals the tax you are resisting (or formally allows that you are exempt from it), or it more informally stops enforcing the tax or taking action against resisters.\n\n[Appeal to a more powerful government to take your side.](../appealtoamorepowerfulgovernment/)\n: Some tax resistance campaigns succeed by appealing to another, more powerful or overarching government to side with them and against the inferior government that enforces the tax.\n\n[Help perpetuate an unorganized, leaderless, tax strike.](../perpetuatealeaderlesstaxstrike/)\n: Finally, in some cases, people realize that they can refuse a tax—or set their own terms for how and how much of it will be collected—without any need for a change in the laws.\n  Sometimes tax resistance becomes so ubiquitous and ordinary that the government is helpless, even if it never formally surrenders.\n\nThe remaining sections of this chapter discuss these scenarios in more detail, and give examples of how they have played out in a variety of campaigns.\n\nIn the following chapter, “The Revolution Is Within You,” I consider a different sort of victory scenario entirely—one in which individual tax resisters fight and win their own solitary revolutions.\nSometimes tax resistance isn’t a fight for some other cause, but a victory itself.","src/content/docs/tacticsthatlaygroundworkforvictory/introduction.mdx","aab7df8e3df9d146","tacticsthatlaygroundworkforvictory/perpetuatealeaderlesstaxstrike",{"id":905,"data":907,"body":913,"filePath":914,"digest":915,"deferredRender":16},{"title":908,"description":909,"editUrl":16,"head":910,"template":52,"sidebar":911,"pagefind":16,"draft":39},"Help

organization or runs a formal campaign, but is nonetheless so powerful and successful that it makes the offensive tax a dead letter.\n\nYale professor James C. Scott studies leaderless, grassroots resistance—and he has noted some examples of tax resistance that follow this pattern.\nSuch “everyday resistance,” as he calls it, has many advantages: it is hard for the government to combat, it can snowball under its own momentum, and it promises an easy payoff to individual resisters without requiring much risk or responsibility.\n“[T]he peasantry’s most common and durable weapon,” Scott says, “is an everyday resistance that stops short of the more dangerous forms of overt protest and confrontation.”\n\n> Everyday resistance does not throw up the manifestos, demonstrations, or pitched battles that normally compel attention.\n> It makes no headlines.\n> But just as millions of anthozoan polyps create, willy-nilly, a coral reef, so do thousands of individual acts of insubordination and evasion create a political and economic barrier reef of their own.\n> There is rarely any dramatic confrontation, any movement that is particularly newsworthy.\n> And whenever, to pursue the simile, the ship of state runs aground on such a reef, attention is typically directed to the shipwreck (for example, a fiscal crisis) itself and not to the vast aggregation of petty acts that made it possible.\n\nFor example, when the government of Malaysia nationalized the traditional Islamic tithe in 1960, made it mandatory, set its rate, and started assessing the property of farmers to determine how much they must pay, the farmers developed a variety of quiet strategies to reduce the tithe to levels they felt were more appropriate.\nScott summarizes the resistance this way:\n\n> There have been no tithe riots, no tithe demonstrations, no petitions, no violent confrontations, no protests of any kind.\n> Why protest, indeed, when quieter stratagems have achieved the same results at minimal risk?\n> …[I]t is the safer course for resisters to leave the tithe system standing in name while they dismantle it in practice… without affording the state an easily discernible target.\n> There is no organization to be banned, no conspiratorial leaders to round up or buy off, no rioters to haul before the courts—only the generalized non-compliance by thousands of peasants.\n\nBecause members of the exploited class typically lack meaningful access to the legislative and administrative levers of power, they wisely take their political stand instead at the point of enforcement.\nAs Thoreau put it:\n\n> I meet this American government, or its representative the State government, directly, and face to face, once a year, no more, in the person of its tax-gatherer; this is the only mode in which a man situated as I am necessarily meets it; and it then says distinctly, Recognize me; and the simplest, the most effectual, and, in the present posture of affairs, the indispensablest mode of treating with it on this head, of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for it, is to deny it then.\n\nSome taxes are just so widely ignored and difficult to enforce that although they remain on the books, they exist only in a state of hibernation.\nFor example, those American states that have a sales tax cannot enforce that tax on merchants from other states—so when their subjects purchase products from out-of-state vendors, the states try to recover their cut by means of a “use tax” that is due from the purchaser.\nThis means that everyone is supposed to keep careful track of how much they’ve spent on such things throughout the year and then write a check to their state government for the use tax.\nIn practice, almost nobody does this, and the tax might as well not be on the books at all, at least as it applies to the ordinary consumer.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Pennsylvania Women\n\nShortly after women in Pennsylvania won the vote they discovered that they’d become taxed as a booby prize.\nMany found the bargain unsatisfactory and refused to pay.\nThey were also upset that the tax law exempted people in urban areas (Philadelphia and Pittsburgh), which put the burden of the tax on rural families.\nResistance sprung up all across the state, without any hints of formal organization that I have been able to uncover, and persisted for several years.\nIt had the authorities thoroughly stymied.\nSome news accounts from the period gave counts of resisters in different regions, including:\n\n* 89 women in Pottstown\n* 300 women in Darby\n* 1,700 women in Charleroi\n* 800 women in Haverford\n* 250 women in Media\n* 700 women in Clifton Heights\n* 200 women in Freeland\n\nOn occasion, a contracting tax collector would go to the government and request that the resisting women be stricken from the tax rolls so that the collector would not be responsible for their taxes.\nSometimes such requests were granted—as in the case of Clifton Heights, where those women who \u003Cem>had\u003C/em> paid up then indignantly demanded refunds.\n\nWith resisters numbering in the thousands, and resistance taking place over several years, this was one of the major tax rebellions in American history.\nYet because it had no leaders or formal organization, issued no manifestos or petitions, and never held big, photogenic rallies or marches, it is nearly unsung in the historical record.\n\n## What It Takes\n\nScott says that there are three factors that contribute to the adoption of “everyday resistance”:\n\n1. “a palpable ‘climate of opinion’”—a widespread belief that the tax is unjust and that resistance is proper\n1. “a shared knowledge of the available techniques of evasion”\n1. “economic interest”—personal economic benefit of refusal to pay the tax\n\nTogether these “can produce a form of tacit coordination that mimics or substitutes for formal organization.”\n\nScott says that once tax resistance becomes normal, it becomes lawful by a sort of shared consensus, whatever the actual statutes say.\nA government that wants to begin enforcing a tax in defiance of this consensus must exercise extraordinary effort to do so, and will probably be seen as exceeding its authority.\n\nScott suggests that “the social historian could profitably examine the role of petty tax resistance in producing, over time, the ‘fiscal crisis of the state’ which frequently presages radical political change.\nHere too, without intending it, the small self-serving acts of thousands of petty producers may deprive a regime of the wherewithal to maintain its ruling coalition and prevail against its enemies.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Scott, James C. “Resistance without Protest and without Organization: Peasant Opposition to the Islamic Zakat and the Christian Tithe” \u003Ci>Comparative Studies in Society and History\u003C/i> July 1987, pp. 417–52\n* Scott, James C. \u003Ci>Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance\u003C/i> (1985) p. 36\n* Thoreau, H.D.

through the entreaties of the lord of the manor, who sees scythes and sabres aimed at his own head, they are released only on the condition that they “abjure their employment.”\n\n> At Saint-Etienne-en-Forez, Berthéas, a clerk in the excise office, falsely accused of monopolizing grain, is fruitlessly defended by the National Guard; he is put in prison, according to the usual custom, to save his life, and, for greater security, the crowd insist on his being fastened by an iron collar.\n> But, suddenly changing its mind, it breaks upon the door and drags him to death.\n> Stretched on the ground, his head still moves and he raises his hand to it, when a woman, picking up a large stone, smashes his skull.—These are not isolated occurrences.\n\n> [A]t Béziers, thirty-two employés, who had seized a quantity of contraband salt on the persons of armed smugglers, are pursued by the crowd to the Hôtel-de-Ville; the consuls decline to defend them and run away; the troops defend them, but in vain.\n> Five are tortured, horribly mutilated, and then hung.\n\n> “The arrears of taxes to be collected is here very considerable, while all proceedings of constraint are dangerous and impossible to execute, owing to the fears of the bailiffs, who dare not perform their duties, and the violence of the tax-payers, on whom there is no check.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Whiskey Rebellion\n\nOnce violent assault becomes a credible enough outcome for tax collectors, the implicit threat itself can be a deterrent (in much the same way that government violence may eventually lead to “peaceful,” “voluntary” compliance with its orders).\n\nFor example, during the Whiskey Rebellion, a process server excused his failure to complete his job by saying “from a variety of threats to himself personally, although he took the utmost precaution to conceal his errand, that he was not only convinced of the impossibility of serving the process, but that any attempt to effect it would have occasioned the most violent opposition from the greater part of the inhabitants;

went in his door and windows, and his deserted smithy was practically destroyed.…\n>\n> At the outset of these proceedings the toll-man “Dick” contrived, by running over ditch and dell, to warn a parish constable, one Evan Thomas, otherwise “The Porthyrhyd Lion,” of his own mishap, as well as the peril to which he thought him exposed, Evan being somewhat unpopular in the neighbourhood.\n> On receiving this hint, away bolted “Ianto,” scampering over the ditches and fields until he found a cow-house where he lay concealed in anxious suspense the remainder of the night.\n> Notwithstanding the retreat of “Ianto,” about seventy of the tribe visited his domicile, smashed in his windows and doors, destroyed his shelf and dresser, and all his crockery, as well as the spokes of a new cart, put a cheese on the fire, cut down some of the trees in the garden, and then simultaneously raised the cry, “Alas! poor Ianto!”…\n> Evan the constable… if found, was to have his ears cut off.…\n>\n> These riotous proceedings caused considerable excitement and alarm…\n> The different persons in the neighbourhood who were sworn in as special constables… gave up their staves, with the determination of refusing on any future occasions to interfere with the movements of Rebecca or the protection of the toll-house.\n\n> John Evans and John Lewis, two Sheriff’s officers from Carmarthen, were sent… to make a distress on the goods and chattels of William Philipp…\n> They were attacked by about twenty-five of the ’Beccas, and beaten in a dreadful manner.…\n> John Evans was compelled to go on his knees before them, and put the distresses and authority to distrain in the fire.\n> He was then made to take his oath on the Bible, which one of them put in his hands, that he would never again enter the premises to make another distress.\n> He was compelled to make use of the following words: “As the Lord liveth, and my soul liveth, I will never come here to make any distress again.”\n> After taking the oath, he was set free, and the two bailiffs returned to town.\n\n> William Chambers, who led a police unit that wounded and arrested some Rebeccaites, was targeted multiple times.\n> On one occasion, a stack of his corn was burned, on another, a stack of straw met the torch.\n> Later his farm and outbuildings were all engulfed in flames.\n> A horse of his that had been rescued from another of his farms as it burned down was later shot.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Tithe War\n\nDuring the Tithe War in Ireland, British troops killed 18 resisters who were trying to reclaim seized livestock.\nIn return, the resisters killed 18 troops in an ambush:\n\n> A number of writs against defaulters were issued by the Court of Exchequer, and intrusted to the care of process-servers, who, guarded by a strong force, proceeded on their mission with secrecy and despatch.\n> Bonfires along the surrounding hills, however, and shrill whistles through the dell, soon convinced them that the people were not unprepared for hostile visitors.\n> But the yeomanry pushed boldly on: their bayonets were sharp, their ball-cartridge inexhaustible, their hearts dauntless.\n> Suddenly an immense mass of peasantry, armed with scythes and pitchforks, poured down upon them—a terrible struggle ensured, and in a few moments eighteen police, including the commanding-officer, lay dead.\n> The remainder fled, marking the course of their retreat by their blood…\n> In the \u003Ci>mêlée\u003C/i>, Captain Leyne, a Waterloo veteran, narrowly escaped.\n> A coroner’s jury pronounced “Wilful murder.”\n> Large Government rewards were offered, but failed to produce a single conviction.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* “Island authorities denounce attack on tax police” Associated Press 19 August 2012\n* Burns, Danny \u003Ci>Poll Tax Rebellion\u003C/i> AK Press (1992), pp. 85, 89 (quoting a rioter who was quoted in the New Statesman, 6 April 1990), 98\n* “Massacre of Peasants Threatened” \u003Ci>Syracuse Journal\u003C/i> 27 September 1906, p. 1\n* A letter by George Rice Trevor quoted in an appendix to Evans, Henry Tobit \u003Ci>Rebecca Riots!\u003C/i> (2010 ed.) p. 213\n* Evans, Henry Tobit \u003Ci>Rebecca Riots!\u003C/i> (2010 ed.), pp. 113–14, 151, 156, 167\n* Fitzpatrick, William John \u003Ci>The Life, Times, and Correspondence of the Right Rev.

protesters surrounded the home of a bailiff company’s chief, and, when they found that the target of their protest was not at home…\n\n> …had a look at his double garage—the door was open.…\n> Well, there wasn’t a car inside, but there was a mountain bike, fishing tackle, clothes, bottles of wine, garden equipment.\n> In fact, the place was chock-a-block.\n> A mock auction was held in front of the press.\n> Anyway, his possessions ended up strewn all over the garden, and slogans were daubed across the back of his wall:\n> “Fuck off bailiff, we’ll be back!”\n> The police arrived about five minutes after we had gone.\n> We heard that Mr. Roach [the bailiff company chief] was escorted home later that night in a police car.\n> It’s good to give people like that a taste of their own medicine.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Rebecca Riots\n\nThis tactic was used frequently during the Rebecca Riots in Wales.\n\nHundreds of Rebeccaites surrounded the home of tithe collector Rees Goring Thomas and fired guns through the windows at the terrified occupants.\n\n> [P]arts of the walls were so thickly marked with shots and slugs that scarcely a square inch was free from them, while the windows and curtain were thickly perforated…\n> There were in all fifty-two panes of glass broken in five windows.…\n> several of the mob forced open the door, and entered the beautiful walled garden adjoining the house, where they committed devastations of a most disgraceful character.\n> Nearly all the apple trees and wall-fruit trees of different kinds, were entirely destroyed, being cut to pieces or torn up from the roots.\n> The various plants and herbs with which the garden abounded were all destroyed, and a row of commodious greenhouses, extending from one side of the garden to the other, was attacked, and a large quantity of glass broken with stones.\n\nThat same crowd then attacked the home of a game warden, firing a blank cartridge directly into the face of his wife.\n\n> They then broke the clock, a very good one, an old pier-glass which had been handed down for several generations, the chairs, table, and all the little furniture the poor people possessed.\n> They also carried away the gamekeeper’s gun, and 10s. or 12s. worth of powder and shot, and previous to leaving took from the drawers all the clothes of the family, which were torn, trodden upon, and partly burnt.\n> They then left the place, after firing several times.\n> Several of the painted doors, leading from the road to the plantation, were destroyed by the Rebeccaites.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Masaniello’s Revolt\n\nIn Naples, in 1647, people attacked the homes of tax farmers:\n\n> …first that of the cashier of taxes,

persons who were concerned in the farming of tolls, as well as all members of the government, saw their houses demolished.…\n> Above forty palaces and houses were consumed by the flames on this day, or were razed to the ground.\n\nInterestingly, when one of the rioters tried to pocket a jewel from one of the destroyed houses, “he was violently upbraided by the rest,” which shows that the point of

accompanied the British women’s suffrage movement.\nDora Montefiore barred the doorway of her home against bailiffs in 1906 and held out for six weeks before they broke through—all the while “addressing the frequent crowds through the upper windows of the house.”\n\n> WSPU [Women’s Social and Political Union] meetings were held in front of the house daily, and resolutions were taken “that taxation without representation is tyranny.”\n> After six weeks, the Crown was legally authorized to break down the door in order to seize property in lieu of taxes, a process to which Montefiore submitted, saying, “It was useless to resist \u003Ci>force majeure\u003C/i> when it came to technical violence on the part of the authorities.”\n\nThe “Siege of Montefiore” was a publicity coup for the movement, and a useful rallying point for activists.\n\n> On the little terrace of the front garden hung during the whole time of the siege a red banner with the letters painted in white:\n> “Women should vote for the laws they obey and the taxes they pay.”\n\nKate Harvey barricaded her home in 1912.\nIt took seven months for the authorities to crowbar their way in and seize her dining room furniture to auction for back taxes.\nThe Women’s Freedom League reported:\n\n> Passers-by read the bold declaration that she refuses to be taxed by a Government that refuses her representation because she is a woman.\n> Her continued resistance has aroused keen interest in the London and Provincial Press, and afforded excellent “copy” for numerous illustrated papers.\n\nThe following year she built a stronger barricade.\nAfter trying in vain for two hours to wrestle their way in, officers resorted to a battering ram:\n\n> Finally, after a heavy beam was used as a battering ram, the door went in with a crash.\n> The door, however, led only to a narrow passage, where a still more obstinate door barred the way.\n> A crowbar, battering ram, and a small jemmy were here brought into use, but even with those it was nearly half an hour before the door, almost splintered, gave way.\n> Later, the hall was entered, where the tax collector was met by Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Despard.\n> Here was little furniture visible, and it was not until a locksmith had forced the door of the dining room that the bailiff was able to place his levy upon goods.\n> The amount of the tax, it is understood, is about £15.\n\nWhen the tax collector and bailiff came to seize goods from Isabella Harrison,\n\n> [She] gave instructions for the tradesmen’s entrance and windows to be locked and bolted, and herself opened the inner front door, closing it behind her and keeping her hand on the handle.\n> The Tax Collector, who was standing with the bailiff inside the outer front door, asked if he was addressing Mrs. Darent Harrison, and hoped she would allow him to execute his trying task and produced his paper.\n> Mrs. Harrison asked and was told the names of the local magistrates who had signed the warrant, and explained that her house could only be entered by force.…\n> The Tax Collector protested that he could not employ force against a woman—that was quite out of the question.\n> Mrs. Harrison then suggested that if he did not intend to stand there till he or she collapsed he must either employ force or call in the police to do so.\n> He scoffed at the idea of sending for the police, but finally sent the bailiff to see if he could find any.\n> But no police were to be found.\n> The bailiff was next sent to get his dinner, and when he returned he reported “still no police anywhere to be found.”\n> It was a complete impasse.\n> They had been facing one another for three hours, and the Tax Collector seemed equally determined to “do his duty” and not to be guilty of even a technical assault on an elderly woman.\n> It was only after being taunted with cowardice—with fear of the consequences of meeting moral with physical force—that he finally made an effort to get control of the handle of the door, and so with the assistance of the bailiff to force his way in.\n\nOn an earlier occasion when Harrison barricaded herself inside her home, supporters brought her food and supplies by means of a basket she lowered from a window by a rope.\n\nThere is at least one report of similar barricades in the American women’s suffrage movement.\nLillie Devereaux Blake addressed a New York Women’s Suffrage Society meeting in 1873, and…\n\n> …narrated several anecdotes of vigorous ladies, who, in the security of their own castles, had defied all the approaches of the tax collector.\n> One lady, she said, was in the habit of barricading herself in her house whenever the tax collector made his appearance, getting into a top room of the house, and from that coign of vantage, delaying the minion of the Government with potations from her parlors.\n> [Laughter.]\n> In this case, Mrs. Blake said it was suspected that the collector had paid the taxes himself, rather than submit to the convincing streams of the lady’s eloquence.\n> [Laughter.]\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> War Tax Resisters\n\nWhen the U.S. government seized their home in 1989, war tax resisters Randy Kehler and Betsy Corner refused to leave—in defiance of a federal court order.\nWhen Kehler was arrested and imprisoned for contempt of court, a dozen affinity groups maintained a round-the-clock occupation of the home in shifts all the way through 1992.\n\nThen there’s this amusing tale:\n\n> Early one morning in 1968 Karl North (Rochester, N.Y.) was alerted by neighbors that the IRS had seized his car and was about to have it towed for $11.29 in unpaid telephone tax.\n> Without time to grab his car key, Karl rushed out of the house and lay down under the car.\n> This disconcerted the IRS enough that when they stopped everything to call the police, he ran back into the house, got the key, rushed back out, and drove the car off.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Blue Shirts\n\nThe Irish right-wing “Blue Shirt Party” held a rally in County Cork in August, 1934 to protest government property seizures against tax resisters.\n“While the conference was sitting, County Cork farmers felled trees in the roads, cut telephone wires and made other efforts to prevent further seizure of cattle for unpaid annuities.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Poll Tax Resistance\n\nResisters used barricades successfully in the battle against Thatcher’s poll tax:\n\n> Over 300 people turned up outside [Jeannette McGuin’s] house.\n> Banners were hung out of the window saying “God Help the Sheriffs.”\n> The sheriffs didn’t show up and Jeannette McGuin never heard another word from them.…\n> [I]n Edinburgh over 300 people filled a central high street to prevent a poinding… 200 activists guarded flats in the Grass Market area… and 150 people guarded 11 flats in Stockbridge and Comely Bank.\n\nJackie Moyers of the Mayfield/Newtongrange Anti-Poll Tax Union reported:\n\n> The very first poinding which was supposed to have been taking place was in a small village called Pathead…\n>\n> The back of eight o’clock everybody started coming up, they actually started running a relay service, a shuttle service with cars going to collect people, and I’d say by about half-past nine to ten o’clock we had 110 people standing in the garden.\n> It was a beautiful day, it was like everybody was sunbathing, having a day out; we stood about there, everybody singing songs, we had the records on, a couple of them had a wee drink, things like that, waiting on the sheriff officers coming…\n>\n> The sheriff officers turned up, got on the phone and, lo and behold, a police car turned up…\n> So the police came up and asked us if the sheriff officers could get in and I said, “Well, I’m telling you, under no circumstances whatsoever are we allowing any sheriff officers into anybody’s house to carry out a poinding.”\n>\n> …So the sheriff officers turned around to the police, and says “I want him arrested, because he’s organising this,” and the police says, “well, we can’t do a thing.”\n> And everyone in the garden, I says to them, well, “They want me arrested.”\n> They says, “Well, if you’re getting arrested then all of us are getting arrested.”\n> And by this time, the local coalman had come up the road in his lorry, stopped his lorry and blocked the street.\n> The two guys at the back jumped off, and the coalman who was driving the lorry, they jumped over the fence and joined us.\n> The local council workers, who were doing the windows at the time, downed their tools and got in the garden and supported us.\n> It’s worse than jungle drums, because the local baker heard it, he came around with his baker’s van and started dishing out cakes to us.\n> The sheriff officers were getting quite panicky by this time.\n> The police got in their car and left the

It’s a waste of your time. We know you’re not going to get in, so there’s nothing else you can do.”…\n> They tried to get in for five or ten minutes and by this time the crowd were getting quite hostile, and I says, “I think you’d better go to your car while you’ve still got four wheels and you’re still able to walk.”\n\nAt Bishops Lydeard, people “divided up into small groups and blockaded every road into the village”:\n\n> Barricades were constructed and every vehicle which tried to enter was stopped and asked its business.…\n> In the end, the bailiffs didn’t come near the place.\n\nPoll tax resisters also sometimes occupied or blockaded the offices of sheriffs and bailiffs.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Annuity Tax Resistance\n\nDuring the Edinburgh Annuity Tax resistance campaign, resisters used blockades to prevent property seizure and to obstruct the movement of constables when they were trying to arrest resisters.\nHere are some excerpts from testimony given during a government investigation of the Annuity Tax disturbances:\n\n> …I saw sledge hammers and other instruments there to open the premises and get at the goods, but after labouring for half an hour or more they could not effect an entrance.\n>\n> Q: Was that because Mr. Dun used some of the metal in which he was a dealer to barricade his premises?\n>\n> A: Yes; tons of metal were put up against the back door, and it was impossible for them to get in.230\n>\n> Mr. Dunn had barricaded the door of the room where the poinded effects were, so that an entrance could not be had…\n> I found that the room where the poinded goods were was filled up to above the centre of the room with boxes filled with plates of iron of immense weight.\n> We were told that the poinded goods were lying beneath those, and that we might get at them as we could.\n> I sent for labourers, and had the whole of those boxes removed into the front shop until I got access, after great trouble, to the sheets of brass, which were the poinded articles.\n> These were then declared by the sheriff officers to be of a different description, and inferior to what they had previously poinded; they refused to take them; and the only articles they recognised were some coils of copper wire; those they took to the police office, and those were all that were obtained on that occasion.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nDuring the Bardoli tax strike, farmers barricaded their homes with their cattle inside to protect them from seizure.\n\n> When the attachment operations began, minute instructions were issued to meet every situation.\n> In the beginning only those who had received notices were to greet the attachment parties with closed doors.\n> Then whole villages were turned into black holes, and people who could not put up with the terrible strain involved were humourously asked to undertake a pilgrimage.\n> When it was found that in spite of the greatest precautions, the Pathans managed to carry away carts, break into enclosures and unhinge closed doors, the Sardar [resistance commander] said: “Pull your carts to pieces.\n> Keep the body in one place, wheels in another, and shafts in a third place; make your hedges extra strong with thorns and bushes; and fortify the doors in such a way that they might not be able to open them except by breaking them open with axes.\n> Exhaust them thoroughly.”…\n\n> In order to save their beloved cattle 80,000 men, women, children with these cattle have locked themselves up in small and insanitary houses for over three months.\n> As I passed through villages, silent, empty and deserted with sentinels posted at different ends, I saw women peeping through the barred windows to see whether it was the arrival of the \u003Ci>japti\u003C/i> [attachment] officer and, on being reassured, the doors being opened, I was taken inside and I saw the darkness, the stench, the filth; and the men, women and children who had herded for months in the same room with their beloved cattle—miserable, lacerated, grown whitish by disease—and as I heard their determination to remain in that condition for months rather than abandon their cattle to the tender mercies of the \u003Ci>japti\u003C/i> officer I could not help thinking that the imagination which conceived the dire \u003Ci>japti\u003C/i> methods, the severity which had enforced them, and the policy which had sanctioned them were difficult to be found outside the pages of a history of medieval times.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Nym Mayhall, Laura E. \u003Ci>The Militant Suffrage Movement: Citizenship and Resistance in Britain, 1860–1930\u003C/i> (2003) pp. 34–35\n* Montefiore, Dora \u003Ci>From a Victorian to a Modern\u003C/i> (1925)\n* “Mrs. Harvey’s Unbroken Barricade” \u003Ci>The Vote\u003C/i> 15 June 1912, p. 134\n* “Battering Ram Used” \u003Ci>Adelaide Register\u003C/i> 29 December 1913, p. 9\n* “Tax Resistance” \u003Ci>The Vote\u003C/i> 13 July 1917, p. 282\n* “The New-York Woman’s Suffrage Society” \u003Ci>The New York Times\u003C/i> 17 December 1873\n* Hedemann, Ed “War Tax Resisters in History” \u003Ci>More Than a Paycheck\u003C/i> October/November 2010, p. 7\n* “Irish Blue Shirts Plan Tax Strike” Associated Press dispatch found in the \u003Ci>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\u003C/i>, 20 August 1934, p. 2\n* “Blue Shirts On Guard” Havas dispatch found in \u003Ci>The Montreal Gazette\u003C/i>, 15 August 1935, p. 3\n* Burns, Danny \u003Ci>Poll Tax Rebellion\u003C/i> AK Press (1992), p. 153–57\n* \u003Ci>Report from the Select Committee on the Edinburgh Annuity Tax Abolition Act\u003C/i> (1866), pp. 88, 101\n* Desai, Mahadev \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i> (1929) pp. 171–72, 218\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/docs/tacticsthatfrustratecountermeasures/blockadetaxcollectors.mdx","a6747d7f8b858ee1","tacticsthatfrustratecountermeasures/clogthecourtsorjails",{"id":960,"data":962,"body":968,"filePath":969,"digest":970,"deferredRender":16},{"title":963,"description":964,"editUrl":16,"head":965,"template":52,"sidebar":966,"pagefind":16,"draft":39},"Clog Up the Courts and/or the Jails","This can force the government into a checkmate, where it loses either if it fails to take action against resisters or if it takes action.",[],{"order":206,"hidden":39,"attrs":967},{},"import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';\n\nSome tax resistance campaigns tried to make tax enforcement or government reprisals against tax resisters costly for the government by clogging the jails or the court system.\nThis can force the government into a checkmate, where if it fails to take legal action against resisters it loses, and if it takes action it also loses.\nBut by forcing resisters to throw themselves onto the gears of the machine, this tactic can be costly to them as well, and can make this tactic something of a game of chicken or a war of attrition.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> John Brown Smith and J.J. Keon\n\nJohn Brown Smith was a British citizen living in the United States.\nNot allowed to vote, as a non-citizen, he decided to test the famous American “no taxation without representation” motto by refusing to pay Belchertown’s $2 poll tax.\nIn 1879 the town threw him in jail.\nThere he stayed… for almost a year!\nThe town had to spend about $1.75 per week just to feed him while he was behind bars.\n\n> Some of the frugal tax-payers of Belchertown object to being assessed for their proportion of Smith’s weekly board bill.\n> They think that they are the real martyrs, since they maintain in idleness a man who will not pay a poll-tax, the proceeds of which would scarcely suffice to pay the cost of maintaining him one week in Northampton Jail.\n> Some nobler spirits, however, express their willingness to pay their share of the cost of Smith’s prison fare until the crack of doom, if Smith should hold out so long, in order that the majesty of the law shall be vindicated.\n> Smith, on his part, exultingly declares that he is better housed and fed than a majority of the voters of Belchertown who are paying his board.\n> This aspect of the case detracts somewhat from the heroism of the martyr to the poll-tax.\n> Nevertheless, as Smith adds that he would rather spend the rest of his days in jail than give up the principle for which he is contending, we may concede that he is a real hero, unaffected by the mercenary considerations of his board bill.\n\nSmith was eventually released when someone came forward to pay his tax and fines (by then, a total of $5.62).\nThis left the government about $75 behind on the deal.\n\nJ.J. Keon similarly tried to wear down the government from within jail after he refused to pay his poll tax in Grafton, Illinois, in 1910:\n\n> J.J. Keon, a Socialist of this city, is in the city jail, having the time of his life, so he says, because he is forcing the city to spend $125 to punish him for failure to pay a poll tax of $1.50…\n> He says he finds nothing in the state constitution which makes a poll tax legal, so he insists that the city keep him in jail for six months, which is the longest term possible for his “offense.”\n> He believes that it will not alter his principle and that it may make the city tired of forcing its male population to pay a poll tax.…\n>\n> “You’re losing $4.50 a day [Keon’s usual salary] while you are in jail,” pleaded the mayor.\n> “In six months that will amount to more than $500.”\n>\n> “Money is nothing to me when compared with a principle,” replied Keon.\n> “And let’s see what I am costing the city.\n> Meals, 150 days, at sixty cents a day, $108; night watchman, $5; chicken fence wire [the city’s improvised prison bars], $2; miscellaneous, $10.\n> Total, $125.\n> The entire poll taxes [collected by the city] for the year are only $325.…”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The Anti-Poll Tax Unions\n\nThe campaign against Thatcher’s poll tax succeeded in clogging the courts.\nIn theory, everyone summonsed for refusal to pay had a legal right to have their case heard, but the councils that implemented the tax were counting on people just rolling over and letting the government have its way without a fight.\n\nCampaign chronicler Danny Burns wrote:\n\n> Initially, neither the councils nor the courts took the judicial procedure seriously because they didn’t expect anyone to turn up…\n> South Tyndale Council summoned 3,500 to appear on two afternoons.\n> A total of five hours was allocated to hear all these cases—an average of four seconds per hearing.\n> When people heard this they were furious, because it was obvious that both the council and the courts saw the process as rubber stamping exercise.…\n\nThe “Anti-Poll Tax Unions” that formed the backbone of the campaign saw this as an exploitable weakness of the government, and they decided to encourage as many people as possible to show up in court and press their cases in the most time- and resource-consuming way the law would permit.\n\n> …People were given ideas about how they might disrupt or delay the court proceedings.\n> These included simple things, like asking for a glass of water because their throat was dry, demanding to see the identity cards of everyone present in court, to fainting in court or arranging for fire alarms to go off.\n> People were told to demand their rights to see and read every document which was produced as evidence against them.\n> They were also given briefings on the basic technical arguments.\n>\n> …Throughout England and Wales over a thousand people were trained to do court support work and could quote the relevant legislation…\n>\n> Experience showed that the most effective way of wasting time, for those who were not familiar with the law, was to relate direct experiences of hardship.\n> People talking in their own language about their own circumstances were much harder for the magistrates to dismiss than legal technicians.\n> Many people made political speeches which lasted for as long as ten minutes, others outlined their financial circumstances.\n> They all took up valuable time, and sometimes made a powerful and moving impact on the public gallery.\n\nSometimes just showing up was enough to crash the system.\nIn Warrington, 1,000 people turned up to contest their cases, and the court, unable to cope, shut down for the day and postponed all of the scheduled cases.\nIn Southwark, 1,500 people came to court and made things so unwieldy that “the police were stopping people from coming into their own court cases.…[and] the court declared all 5,000 cases adjourned.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Turn-about Is Fair Play\n\nUsing the government’s own defenses against it can be a powerful strategy.\nI’ve even got an example in my archives of when the government used this sort of ju-jitsu and managed to frustrate nonviolent tax resisters by using their tactics against them.\n\nDuring the Salt Raids in the Indian independence campaign, a group of policemen blockaded the road in front of an assembly of raiders, and sent another group to cut off their escape route.\nThen, rather than attacking the raiders, the police used satyagraha tactics to force a standoff:\n\n> “You cannot proceed.” the superintendent informed Mrs. [Sarojini] Naidu.\n>\n> “We will not go back,” the poetess and leader replied.\n> “We will stay here.”\n>\n> “We are going to stay here, too, and offer satyagraha ourselves as long as you stay,” the superintendent said, ordering his men to stand their ground.\n>\n> They parleyed for a short time and then Mrs. Naidu ordered a chair brought from a nearby house.\n> She sat down and wrote letters and talked jovially with her friends.\n> Her followers squatted on the ground nearby, many of them engaged in spinning cloth.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* “John Smith,

revolts in Turkey in 1906–07, the government tried to quietly round up the leaders of the rebellion in the dead of night.\nThat didn’t work out too well, as the rebels turned the tables:\n\n> Haci Akif Agha, one of the important local notables and a leader of the revolt… offered a successful resistance to the gendarmes who came to arrest him.\n> His resistance publicised the arrests, and the citizens immediately organised themselves for the release of the prisoners.\n> The morning after the arrests, a large crowd of furious Muslims surrounded the Governor’s residence, demanding the return of the exiles.\n> The Governor escaped to a private house, but was captured and kept prisoner in the İbrahim Pasha Mosque.\n\nThe crowd took revenge against the local police (beating the Chief of Police to death), and went to retrieve exiled resistance leaders, “the Governor having been compelled under the threat of death to give orders for their return.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\"

against the rioters… in order to prevent their giving testimony…”\n\nThe American tax rebels in the Fries Rebellion a few years later did what they could to break their comrades out of custody:\n\n> As soon as it became known the arrests were made, the leaders of the opposition to the law determined to rescue them…\n> Notices were carried around the evening before and left at the houses of those known to be friendly to the movement.\n> By ten o’clock a number of people had assembled, and considerable excitement was manifested.\n> The general sentiment was in favor of immediate organization and marching to Bethlehem to take the prisoners from the hands of the Marshal.\n> The crowd was formed in a company, and John Fries elected captain.\n> They were variously armed; some with guns, others with swords and pistols, while those with less belligerent feelings carried clubs.\n\nFries led a group of about 140 armed rebels to the building where the prisoners were held, and after a tense standoff with the Marshal and about twenty of his posse, the rebels won the release of the prisoners.\nVictory was sweet, but brief, as this event provoked President John Adams to send in federal troops.\n(Fries and some of his companions were captured, convicted of treason, and sentenced to be hanged; Adams pardoned them.)\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Jack a Lents\n\nThe “Jack a Lents”—18th century English forefathers to the Welsh Rebecca Rioters—rescued two of their number who had been arrested for toll booth destruction.\nA news account said:\n\n> [They] demanded the said prisoners, threatening, in case of refusal, to pull [their captor’s] house down, and burn his barns and stables, and immediately discharged several loaded pieces into the house, which happily did no damage.\n> The justice finding himself and family beset in such a manner, discharged several blunderbusses and fowling-pieces at them, whereby one was shot dead on the spot, and several so wounded that ’tis not believed they will recover.\n> At this the rioters fled with precipitation, leaving their two companions behind them.\n\nBut the Jack a Lents weren’t giving up.\nA later dispatch says that about twenty of them confronted the keeper of the county jail:\n\n> …and demanding his reasons for detaining those two men in custody, without giving him time to return an answer, dragged him out of the inn into the street, knocked him down several times, and almost murdered him, notwithstanding all that the innkeeper and his servants could do to prevent it, who were used in a very cruel manner for assisting him.\n> The villains immediately carried the keeper to Wilton’s Bridge, where at first they concluded to throw him into the river Wye; but at length they agreed to carry him to a place where they would secure him till they themselves had fetched the prisoners out of custody.\n> The better to complete that design, they dragged him four miles in his boots and spurs, to a place called Horewithey, a public-house, where he was kept prisoner, beat in a shameful manner by those merciless wretches, and obliged to write a discharge to the turnkey, being threatened, in case of refusal, to be hanged upon the spot.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> British Constitutionalists\n\nIn 2011 hundreds of British “constitutionalist” tax

turn their auction into an occasion for political commentary:\n\n> Difficulty is experienced everywhere in getting auctioneers to sell the property confiscated.\n> In Leominster, a ram and some ewe lambs, the property of a resistant named Charles Grundy, were seized and put up at auction, as follows: Ram, Joe Chamberlain; ewes, Lady Balfour, Mrs. Bishop, Lady Cecil, Mrs. Canterbury, and so on through the list of those who made themselves conspicuous in forcing the bill through Parliament.\n> The auctioneer was entitled to a fee under the law of 10 shillings and 6 pence, which he promptly turned over to Mr. Grundy, having during the sale expressed the strongest sympathy for the tax-resisters.\n> Most of the auction sales are converted into political meetings in which the tax and those responsible for it are roundly denounced.\n\n### \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" /> Edinburgh Annuity Tax Resistance\n\nAuction disruptions were commonplace in the Annuity Tax resistance campaign in Edinburgh.\nBy law the distraint auctions (or “roupings”) had to be held either at the homes of the resisters or at the Mercat Cross—the town square, essentially—which made it easy to gather a crowd:\n\n> [I]magine… an unfortunate auctioneer arriving at the Cross about noon, with a cart loaded with furniture for sale.\n> Latterly the passive hubbub rose as if by magic.\n> Bells sounded, bagpipes brayed, the Fiery Cross passed down the closses, and through the High Street and Cowgate; and men, women, and children, rushed from all points towards the scene of \u003Cem>Passive Resistance\u003C/em>…\n> Respectable shopkeepers might be seen coming in haste from the Bridges; Irish traders flew from St. Mary’s Wynd; brokers from the Cowgate; all pressing round the miserable auctioneer; yelling, hooting, perhaps cursing, certainly saying anything but what was affectionate or respectful of the clergy.\n> And here were the black placards tossing above the heads of the angry multitude—\n>\n> ROUPING FOR STIPEND!\n>\n> This notice was of itself enough to deter any one from purchasing…\n> The people lodged the placards and flags in shops about the Cross, so that not a moment was lost in having their machinery in full operation, and scouts were ever ready to spread the intelligence if any symptoms of a sale were discovered.\n\nIt was difficult for the authorities to get any help, either from auctioneers, furniture dealers, or carters.\nThe government had to purchase (and fortify) their own cart because they were unable to rent one for such use.\n\nBefore a committee that was investigating the resistance campaign, a witness testified about a disrupted auction that was held at a resister’s home:\n\n> I saw a large number of the most respectable citizens assembled in the house, and a large number outside awaiting the arrival of the officers who came in a cab, and the indignation was very strong when they got into the house, so much so that a feeling was entertained by some that there was danger to the life of Mr. Whitten, the auctioneer, and that he might be thrown out of the window, because there were such threats, but others soothed down the feeling.…\n>\n> Q: Did Mr. Whitten, from his experience on that occasion, refuse ever to come to another sale as auctioneer?\n>\n> A: He refused to act again, he gave up his position.\n\nOn another occasion, the auction seemed to go smoothly at first, but the buyers didn’t get what they hoped for:\n\n> At Mr. McLaren’s sale everything was conducted in an orderly way as far as the sale was concerned.\n> We got in, and only a limited number were allowed to go in; but after the officials and the police had gone, there was a certain amount of disturbance.\n> Certain goods were knocked down [sold] to the poinding creditors, consisting of an old sofa and an old sideboard, and Mr. McLaren said, “Let those things go to the clergy.”\n> Those were the only things which had to be taken away.\n> There was no vehicle ready to carry them away.\n> Mr. McLaren said that he would not keep them.\n> After the police departed, he turned them out in the street, when they were taken possession of by the crowd of idlers, and made a bonfire of.\n\nA summary of the effect of all of this disruption reads:\n\n> So strong was the feeling of hostility, that the town council were unable to procure the services of any auctioneer… and they were consequently forced to make a special arrangement with a sheriff’s officer, by which, to induce him to undertake the disagreeable task, they provided him for two years with an auctioneer’s license from the police funds.\n> In March 1865, it was found necessary to enter into another arrangement with the officer, by which the council had to pay him 12½ percent, on all arrears, including the police, prison, and registration rates, as well as the clerical tax; and he receives this percentage whether the sums are recovered by himself or paid direct to the police collector, and that over and above all the expenses he recovers from the recusants.\n> But this is not all; the council were unable to hire a cart or vehicle from any of the citizens, and it was found necessary to purchase a lorry, and to provide all the necessary apparatus and assistance for enforcing payment of the arrears.\n> All this machinery, which owes its existence entirely to the Clerico-Police Act, involves a wasteful expenditure of city funds, induces a chronic state of irritation in the minds of the citizens, and is felt to be a gross violation of the principles of civil and religious liberty.\n\n### \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" /> The Tithe War\n\nWilliam John Fitzpatrick wrote of the auctions during the Tithe War in Ireland:\n\n> [T]he parson’s first step was to put the cattle up to auction in the presence of a regiment of English soldiery; but it almost invariably happened that either the assembled spectators were afraid to bid, lest they should incur the vengeance of the peasantry, or else they stammered out such a low offer, that, when knocked down, the expenses of the sale would be found to exceed it.\n> The same observation applies to the crops.\n> Not one man in a hundred had the hardihood to declare himself the purchaser.\n> Sometimes the parson… would order the cattle twelve or twenty miles away in order to their being a second time put up for auction.\n> But the locomotive progress of the beasts was always closely tracked, and means were taken to prevent either driver or beast receiving shelter or sustenance throughout the march.\n\nThe Sentinel wrote of one auction:\n\n> Yesterday being the day on which the sheriff announced that, if no bidders could be obtained for the cattle, he would have the property returned to Mr. Germain, immense crowds were collected from the neighbouring counties—upwards of 20,000 men.\n> The County Kildare men, amounting to about 7,000, entered… in the most regular and orderly manner.\n> This body was preceded by a band of music, and had several banners on which were “Kilkea and Moone, Independence for ever,” “No Church Tax,” “No Tithe,” “Liberty,” etc…\n> The cattle were ordered out, when the sheriff, as on the former day, put them up for sale; but no one could be found to bid for the cattle, upon which he announced his intention of returning them to Mr. Germain.\n> The news was instantly conveyed, like electricity, throughout the entire meeting, when the huzzas of the people surpassed anything we ever witnessed.\n> The cattle were instantly liberated and given up to Mr. Germain.…\n> Thus terminated this extraordinary contest between the Church and the people, the latter having obtained, by their steadiness, a complete victory.\n> The cattle will be given to the poor of the sundry districts.\n\nSimilar scenes were reported elsewhere:\n\n> Some cows seized for tithes were brought to a public place for sale, escorted by a squadron of lancers, and followed by thousands of infuriated people.\n> All the garrison, cavalry and infantry, under the command of Sir George Bingham, were called out.\n> The cattle were set up at three pounds for each, no bidder; two pounds, no bidder; one pound, no bidder; in short, the auctioneer descended to three shillings for each cow, but no purchaser appeared.\n> This scene lasted for above an hour, when there being no chance of making sale of the cattle, it was proposed to adjourn the auction; but, as we are informed, the General in command of the military expressed an unwillingness to have the troops subjected to a repetition of the harassing duty thus imposed on them.\n> After a short delay, it was, at the interference and remonstrance of several gentlemen, both of town and country, agreed upon that the cattle should be given up to the people, subject to certain private arrangements.\n> We never witnessed such a scene; thousands of country people jumping with exulted feelings at the result, wielding their shillelaghs, and exhibiting all the other symptoms of exuberant joy characteristic of the buoyancy of Irish feeling.\n>\n> At Carlow… Some cattle had been seized for tithe, and a public sale announced, when a large body of men, stated at 50,000, marched to the place appointed, and, of course, under the influence of such terror, none were found to bid for the cattle.\n> The sale was adjourned from day to day, for seven days, and upon each day the same organised bands entered the town, and rendered the attempt to sell the cattle, in pursuance of the law, abortive.\n> At last the cattle are given up to the mob, crowned with laurels, and driven home with an escort of 10,000 men.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nTax resisters in the women’s suffrage movement in the U.K. were particularly adept at disrupting tax auctions and making them opportunities for propaganda and protest.\n\n> Practically every day sees a sale and protest somewhere, and the banners of the Women’s Tax Resistance League, frequently supported by Suffrage Societies, are becoming familiar in town and country.\n> At the protest meetings which follow all sales the reason why is explained to large numbers of people who would not attend a suffrage meeting.\n> Auctioneers are becoming sympathetic even so far as to speak in support of the women’s protest against a law which demands their money, but gives them no voice in the way in which it is spent.\n\nSometimes sympathetic auctioneers allowed activists to address bidders before the auction began.\nIn this way, the auctions spread the suffragist message to new audiences.\nIndeed, suffragists would often walk through town with sandwich-boards, banners, and leaflets advertising and protesting the auction to try to draw a crowd.\n\nAt one auction, a suffrage activist called out for “three cheers” for the tax resister whose goods had been auctioned off, and “[t]he hearty response from the men… came as a surprise to the Suffragists themselves.”\nOn another, the gathering came to resemble a suffrage rally more than an auction:\n\n> The sale was conducted, laughably enough, under the auspices of the Women’s Freedom League and the Women’s Tax Resistance League…\n> The rostrum was spread with our flag proclaiming the inauguration of Tax Resistance by the W.F.L.; above the auctioneer’s head hung Mrs. Despard’s embroidered silk banner, with its challenge “Dare to be Free”; on every side the green, white and gold of the W.F.L. was accompanied by the brown and black of the Women’s Tax Resistance League, with its cheery “No Vote, no Tax” injunctions and its John Hampden maxims…\n\nSometimes these protests convinced the assembled bidders to refuse to bid on the stolen goods:\n\n> Miss Andrews asked the auctioneer if she might explain the reason for the sale of the waggon, and, having received the necessary permission was able to give an address on tax resistance, and to show how it is one of the weapons employed by the Freedom League to secure the enfranchisement of women.\n> Then came the sale—but beforehand the auctioneer said he had not been aware he was to sell “distressed” goods, and he very much objected to doing so.…\n> The meeting and the auctioneer together made the assembly chary of bidding, and the waggon was not sold, which was a great triumph for the tax-resisters.\n\nA less-sympathetic auctioneer might refuse to allow the activists to address the crowd from the rostrum, only to regret this decision when the activists instead shouted him down from the crowd or from the street outside.\n\nWhen the government seized the goods of tax resisters and auctioned them off, this overt attack tended to unify the opposition and make it overlook its own differences of opinion.\nOne suffragist activist wrote about an auction protest:\n\n> Certainly the most striking feature of this protest was the fact that members of all societies in Hastings, St. Leonards, Bexhill, and Winchelsea united in their effort to render the protest representative of all shades of Suffrage opinion.\n> Flags, banners, pennons, and regalia of many societies were seen in the procession.\n\nThe government once peevishly seized about £80 worth of household goods from a woman who had resisted only about £15 in taxes:\n\n> [I]t was at once decided by the Women’s Tax Resistance League and Mrs. Tollemache’s friends that such conduct on the part of the authorities must be circumvented and exposed.\n> The goods were on view the morning of the sale, and as there was much valuable old china, silver, and furniture, the dealers were early on the spot, and buzzing like flies around the articles they greatly desired to possess.\n> The first two pieces put up were, fortunately, quite inviting; £19 being bid for a chest of drawers worth about 50s. and £3 for an ordinary leather-top table, the requisite amount was realised, and the auctioneer was obliged to withdraw the remaining lots, much to the disgust of the assembled dealers.\n> Mrs. Kineton Parkes, in her speech at the protest meeting, which followed the sale, explained to these irate gentlemen that women never took such steps unless compelled to do so, and that if the tax collector had seized a legitimate amount of goods to satisfy his claim, Mrs. Tollemache would willingly have allowed them to go.”\n\nThe government tried to sell suffragist tax resister Kate Harvey’s property from within her home rather than from a public auction house, thinking that this might make protest more difficult.\nThat turned out to be a miscalculation.\nA group of suffragist men drew a crowd by carrying placards through the town that read “I personally protest against the sale of a woman’s goods to pay taxes over which she has no control.”\nWhen the sale began that afternoon, the crowd and the hubbub had become so intense that the first thing the auctioneer did was to reassure people that it really was an auction they were attending.\n\nKate Harvey then addressed the crowd and explained why she was resisting (“Simply and solely because she was a woman… she had no voice in saying how the taxes collected from her should be spent.”)\n\n> The tax collector suffered this speech in silence, but he could judge by the cheers it received that there were many ardent sympathisers with Mrs. Harvey in her protest.\n> He tried to proceed, but one after another the men present loudly urged that no one there should bid for the goods.\n> The tax-collector feebly said this wasn’t a political meeting, but a genuine sale!\n> “One penny for your goods then!” was the derisive answer. “One penny—one penny!” was the continued cry.…\n>\n> The din increased every moment and pandemonium reigned supreme.\n> During a temporary lull the tax-collector said a sideboard had been sold for nine guineas.\n> Angry cries from angry men greeted this announcement.\n> “Illegal sale!” “He shan’t take it home!” “The whole thing’s illegal!” “You shan’t sell anything else!” and \u003Ci>The Daily Herald\u003C/i> Leaguers, members of the Men’s Political Union, and of other men’s societies, proceeded to make more noise than twenty brass bands.\n> Darkness was quickly settling in; the tax-collector looked helpless, and his deputy smiled wearily.\n> “Talk about a comic opera—it’s better than Gilbert and Sullivan could manage,” roared an enthusiast.\n> “My word, you look sick, guv’nor! Give it up, man!”\n> Then everyone shouted against the other until the tax-collector said he closed the sale, remarking plaintively that he had lost £7 over the job!\n> Ironical cheers greeted this news, with “Serve you right for stealing a woman’s goods!”\n> He turned his back on his tormentors, and sat down in a chair on the table to think things over.\n> The protesters sat on the sideboard informing all and sundry that if anyone wanted to take away the sideboard he should take them with it!\n> With the exit of the tax-collector, his deputy and the bailiff, things gradually grew quieter, and later on Mrs. Harvey entertained her supporters to tea at the Bell Hotel.\n> But the curious thing is, a man paid nine guineas for the sideboard to the tax-collector.\n> Mrs. Harvey owed him more than £17, and Mrs. Harvey is still in possession of the sideboard!\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The American War Tax Resistance Movement\n\nThere have been a few celebrated auction sales in the American war tax resistance movement.\nSome were met with protests or were used as opportunities for outreach, but others have been more actively interfered with.\n\nWhen Ernest and Marion Bromley’s home was seized, for example, there were “months of continuous picketing and leafletting” before the sale.\nThen:\n\n> The day began with a silent vigil initiated by the local Quaker group.\n> While the bids were being read inside the building, guerilla theatre took place out on the sidewalk.\n> At one point the Federal building was auctioned (offers ranging from 25¢ to two bottle caps).\n> Several supporters present at the proceedings inside made brief statements about the unjust nature of the whole ordeal.\n> Waldo the Clown was also there, face painted sadly, opening envelopes along with the IRS person.\n> As the official read the bids and the names of the bidders, Waldo searched his envelopes and revealed their contents: a flower, a unicorn, some toilet paper, which he handed to different office people.\n> Marion Bromley also spoke as the bids were opened, reiterating that the seizure was based on fraudulent assumptions, and that therefore the property could not be rightfully sold.\n\nThese protests, odd as they were, eventually paid off.\nAround the same time that this auction was taking place, the IRS was caught improperly pursuing political dissidents.\nAs the scandal broke the agency decided to reverse the sale of the Bromley home and to give up on that particular fight.\n\nWhen Addie and Paul Snyder’s home was auctioned off for back taxes, it was reported that “many bids of $1 or less were made.”\nA newspaper article on the auction noted:\n\n> Making a bid of pennies for farm property being foreclosed for failure to meet mortgages was a common tactic among angry farmers during the Depression.\n> If their bids succeeded, the property was returned to its owner and the mortgage torn up.\n> In some such cases, entire farms plus their livestock, equipment and home furnishings sold for as little as $2.\n\nWhen Randy Kehler and Betsy Corner’s home was put up in a sealed-bid auction, “The IRS received close to 100 bids, but none was monetary.”\nBids included a package of community service pledges and food for the poor, massages or psychotherapy for IRS employees, free dental work for IRS employees, nonviolence training sessions, and “42 blocks of ice, to symbolize the end of the 42-year Cold War.”\nThe tax agency rejected all the bids.\n\nYou don’t need to disrupt the auction itself in order to frustrate the tax authorities.\nThe seizure and auctioning of a resister’s property is meant to be punitive and discouraging, so if you can make it instead celebratory and \u003Cem>encouraging\u003C/em> you disrupt the auction even if it otherwise proceeds as normal.\nWhen the IRS seized George and Lillian Willoughby’s car to recover about $100 in refused telephone excise tax, the Willoughbys’ friends and supporters raised what they called a “peace bond” of money so they could buy the car back at auction—and they donated the extra money from the “bond” to the local war tax resistance group.\nGeorge Willoughby remembers: “One IRS official complained, ‘here we seize your car to raise money for the IRS, and you are using it to raise money for your cause!’ ”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Reform Act Agitation\n\nDuring the tax resistance that accompanied the drive to pass the Reform Act in the early 1830s in the U.K., hundreds of people signed pledges in which they declared that “they will not purchase the goods of their townsmen not represented in Parliament which may be seized for the non-payment of taxes.”\nA news account asserted:\n\n> The tax-gatherer… might seize for them, but the brokers assured the inhabitants that they would neither seize any goods for such taxes, nor would they purchase goods so seized.\n> Yesterday afternoon, Mr Philips, a broker, in the Broadway, Westminster, exhibited the following placard at the door of his shop:—“Take notice, that the proprietor of this shop will not distrain for the house and window duties, nor will he purchase any goods that are seized for the said taxes; neither will any of those oppressive taxes be paid for this house in future.”\n\nAnd another said:\n\n> A sale by auction of goods taken in distress for assessed taxes was announced.…\n> From forty to fifty persons attended, including some brokers, but no buyer could be found except the poor woman from whose husband the goods had been seized, and the auctioneer himself.\n> A man came when the sale was nearly over, who was perfectly ignorant of the circumstances under which it took place, and bid for one of the last lots; he soon received an intimation, however, from the company that he had better desist, which be accordingly did.\n> After the sale was over nearly the whole of the persons present surrounded this man, and lectured him severely upon his conduct, and it was only by his solemnly declaring to them that he had bid in perfect ignorance of the nature of the sale that he was suffered to escape without some more substantial proof of their displeasure.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Railroad Bond Shenanigans\n\nThere was an epidemic of fraud in the United States in the late nineteenth century in which local jurisdictions were convinced to issue bonds to pay for the railroad to come to town.\nThe railroad never arrived, but the citizens then were on the hook to tax themselves to pay off the bond-holders.\nMany groups of citizens refused, but by then the bonds had been sold to people who were not necessarily involved in the original swindle but who had just bought them as investments, and who filed lawsuits to compel payment.\n\nAuctions were sometimes disrupted in the course of the tax resistance campaigns associated with these railroad bond boondoggles.\nHere are two examples:\n\n> St. Clair [Missouri]’s taxpayers joined the movement in the 1870s to repudiate the debts, but the county’s new leaders wanted to repay the investors.\n> Afraid to try taxing the residents, they decided to raise the interest by staging a huge livestock auction in 1876, the proceeds to pay off the railroad bond interest.\n> On auction day, however, “no one seemed to want to buy” any animals.\n> To bondholders the “great shock” of the auction’s failure proved the depth of local resistance to railroad taxes.\n\n> Another attempt was made… and another failure has followed.\n> The scene was upon the farm of William Atkins, where 200 of the solid yeomanry of the town had assembled to resist the sale…\n> A Mr. Updyke, with broader hint, made these remarks:\n> “I want to tell you folks that Mr. Atkins has paid all of his tax except this railroad tax; and we consider any man who will buy our property… as contemptible sharks.\n> We shall remember him for years, and will know where he lives.”\n> The tax collector finally rose and remarked that in view of the situation he would not attempt to proceed with the sale.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The White League in Louisiana\n\nIn Reconstruction-era Louisiana, a mob of white supremacist tax resisters disrupted a tax auction.\nOne struck the auctioneer when he attempted to sell distrained property, and dozens of others, armed with revolvers, backed him up.\nAs a result:\n\n> …very few people attended tax-sales [typically], because the white people were organized to prevent tax-collection, and pledged themselves not to buy any property at tax-sales, and the property was generally bought by the State.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Piet Bezuidenhout’s Wagon\n\nThe First Boer War broke out in the aftermath of the successfully resisted auction of a tax resister’s wagon.\nThe Boers had been paying taxes to the British reluctantly, but the British brazenly used this reluctant compliance as evidence that the Boers were content under British rule.\nInfuriated, Boer separatists declared they would refuse to pay or would only pay under protest.\nThe British criminally charged the publisher of a Pretoria newspaper for having printed such tax resistance vows.\n\nThe British government took Piet Bezuidenhout to court to try to force him to pay about twice the amount of taxes as was actually lawfully due.\nBezuidenhout offered to pay the actual amount due under protest—an offer the court eventually accepted, but only after adding court costs that brought the total back up to exactly the inflated amount the government had originally asked for.\nBezuidenhout, unwilling to be swindled in this way, refused to pay.\n\nThe government then seized his wagon and attempted to auction it off, but a hundred armed Boers stormed the auction, assaulted the sheriff who was to conduct the sale, and hauled the wagon away.\nWhen the government raised a squadron of police to try to recapture Bezuidenhout, the Boers assembled a small army to resist this attempt.\nRealizing they had forced matters to a head, the Boers declared independence and decided to fight it out.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* \u003Ci>The Daily Saratogian\u003C/i> 28 May 1892, p.

2005 I started collecting media mentions of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) buildings that had to be evacuated because of “an envelope containing an unknown powder” or “a suspicious package” or something of the sort.\nIt seems to be a popular hobby to harass the IRS in this way.\n\n> Michelle Lowry… who processes forms for the IRS in Austin, confronts that venom regularly.\n> People slip razor blades and push-pins into the same envelopes as their W-2 forms.\n> They send nasty notes with their crumpled documents.\n> Last year during the height of the Tea Party movement, hundreds of taxpayers included—what else?—tea bags with their returns.\n> And then there’s the weird stuff.\n> “Sometimes you’ll see stuff that looks like blood on them,” said Lowry, who has worked as a seasonal employee for five years.\n> “We wear gloves.”…\n> She’s been through evacuations caused by suspicious items in the mail, such as white powder.\n> (It turned out to be packing material.)\n\nSometimes these really are explicit threats, for instance an envelope sent to the IRS mail room in Kansas City in 2007 that included white powder and a note that mentioned anthrax (though the powder turned out to be talcum powder).\n\nBut frequently, the “suspicious package” turns out to be something benign but just out-of-the-ordinary enough to cause panic.\nIn Bloomington, Illinois, in 2013, an IRS distribution center was cordoned off while a bomb squad of state and Department of Homeland Security specialists navigated a robot through the parking lot to retrieve and inspect two suspicious packages.\nThe process took five hours, and eventually revealed that the suspicious packages contained… tax forms.\n\nIn such cases, the tax office usually makes a big and very expensive fuss, under the “better safe than sorry” principle.\nThey evacuate the building and call in the bomb squads with their remote-controlled robots or the hazmat teams with their protective clothing and mobile decontamination rooms.\nThe amount of disruption and expense this causes, the small effort needed to provoke it, and the low likelihood of getting caught can make this an attractive tactic.\nAnyone can play this game.\nI’ve even found a case in which 250 IRS employees got to take a long lunch thanks to “a package of foot powder mailed from a prison ZIP code.”\n\nIf there have been enough real or at least credible threats of this sort, the government’s sensitivity will be so high that it may interpret anything unusual as a threat.\nFor example, the protest tactic of sending tea bags to politicians as a way of evoking the Boston Tea Party goes back decades, but when someone sent an envelope containing a tea bag to U.S. Representative Jared Polis in 2009, he called out the hazmat team to open it for him.\nHe wasn’t the only legislator to react this way.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Voodoo Curse\n\nSome threats are more ethereal than material.\nIn July, 2013, IRS agents in McAllen, Texas came to work to find three charred, headless chickens arranged by the front door.\nLocal occult specialists indicated that this was probably the residue left over from an attempt to put a voodoo curse on someone employed there.\nCurse specialist Ana Davila explained:\n“The charred animals in the parking lot point to a person wishing the target of this to veer off the road and have an accident.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Give a Shit\n\nAnd then there’s this, from 2003:\n\n> Angry New Zealand farmers are reportedly sending parcels

bureaucracy.\nAfter all, they’re often taxpayers too, and may ultimately feel more loyalty to their fellow-subjects than to the government they’re subjected to, even if it’s also the government they work for.\n\nTo this end, some tax resistance campaigns have encouraged resignations, defections, and goldbricking among those responsible for carrying out the tax laws.\n\nIn this, they’re following the lead of Thoreau, who wrote:\n\n> If the tax-gatherer, or any other public officer, asks me, as one has done, “But what shall I do?” my answer is, “If you really wish to do anything, resign your

His duty is to speak to the Government on behalf of the village, not to oppress his brethren by attaching their property in order to recover an unjust tax.\n> It is his duty to tell Government that attachment work is below his dignity and self-respect.\n\nSixty patels met and decided unanimously that they would not assist in tax collection.\n\nIn Valod, seven landholders were served notices of forfeiture.\nSheth Virchand wrote back, saying in part:\n\n> If you claim to be a loyal servant of Government, it is your duty to inform them of the true state of things in the \u003Ci>taluka\u003C/i> [district] and help people to get the wrong righted.\n> I humbly request you to find out some means of getting out of the odious task of oppressing the people, when your time to retire is now so

your well-wisher I would ask you to go on leave prior to retirement rather than stain your honour by doing things which do not become you.\n\nAs a result of pressure like this, “the officials who

leaflets was a sample letter that IRS employees could send if they wanted to resign from their jobs.\n\nKanning was arrested by agents from the Department of Homeland Security and charged with distributing materials in a federal building and failure to obey a lawful order.\nAfter he was booked and released, he immediately returned to the IRS office to try again (without the leaflets, which had been confiscated).\nHe was arrested again and charged with disorderly conduct.\n\nA few months later, Dave Ridley followed-up on Kanning’s action, this time at the Nashua IRS office.\nHe silently held up a sign that read “Is it right to work for the IRS?” and passed a leaflet through the window that read in part:\n\n> I have the right to remain silent.\n> IRS agents have the right to quit their jobs.\n> If that is not possible, they have a responsibility to work as inefficiently as possible when taking our money, and as quickly as possible when returning it.\n\nThe police were summoned and they hustled him out of the building.\nThey later cited him for “distribution of handbills.”\n\nKat Kanning and Lauren Canario were the next activists in line.\nThey went to the Keene IRS office with a “Taxes pay for torture” sign and a stack of leaflets.\nThey were charged with “disorderly conduct and loitering [and] failure to obey a lawful order.”\n\nAt every stage in the process, these activists tried to directly but non-aggressively confront not only the IRS employees, but also the Homeland Security officers, court bailiffs, judges, and other government collaborators: asking them why they were interfering with the Constitutional right of American citizens “to petition their government for a redress of grievances,” and asking them to consider taking up a more honorable line of work.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> First Intifada\n\nAt the launching of the first intifada to resist Israeli rule over Palestinians, those Palestinians who worked for the tax department under the Israeli occupation resigned their posts.\nAs a result of these resignations and of organized tax resistance, only about 20% of Palestinians subject to Israeli taxes in the West Bank paid them in 1993, the last year before Israel relinquished tax administration there to the Palestinian Authority.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Greek Tax and Customs Officials\n\nAt the same time that the “won’t pay” tax resistance movement was protesting the Greek government’s policy of raising taxes while imposing austerity budgets, bureaucrats in the Greek tax and customs offices were periodically going on strike in 2010 and 2011 to protest salary and benefit cuts for state employees.\nThis put the two groups into something of a strategic alliance.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> National Treasury Employees Union and War Tax Resisters\n\nTax office employees and tax resisters make for strange bedfellows, but I remember witnessing a somewhat similar case from 2006 in the United States.\nI was participating in a tax day protest with some war tax resisters at a post office in Oakland, California, where we held up banners, handed out flyers, and projected a slide show of war tax resistance propaganda for the traffic jam of last-minute tax return filers.\nWe were joined by some members of the National Treasury Employees Union who came to the post office fresh from a union meeting in order to protest the IRS’s plans to outsource their work to private debt collection agencies.\n\nAt first it seemed awkward to protest alongside IRS employees who today were fighting to protect their jobs but tomorrow might be trying to seize our assets.\nBut those IRS employees who had brought no signs of their own borrowed extra ones from us, and so, to our delight, we had IRS employees and their families protesting against war taxes right alongside us!\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Education Act Resistance\n\nBritish members of nonconforming Christian sects did not want to see their tax money going to official church schools, as the Education Act of 1902 directed, so they resisted their taxes.\nAccording to a newspaper report, they were aided by sympathizers in the tax enforcement bureaucracy:\n\n> In Lincolnshire, the sitting magistrate recently refused to try cases of resistance, and left the bench.\n> Difficulty is experienced everywhere in getting auctioneers to sell the property confiscated.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and

collector or assessor.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Charles Merrill\n\nCharles Merrill, who resisted his taxes as a way of protesting for the legal recognition of same-sex marriage in the United States, said that he had buried a hoard of $2 million in gold coins in the desert.\n“My partner doesn’t even know where it is at,” he said.\n“If the IRS allows me to file a

Doukhobor sect refused to pay school taxes on their farmland in Canada (reasoning that since they would not send their children to godless Canadian schools, they shouldn’t have to pay for them), they anticipated that the government might resort to property seizure.\nSo they “very thoughtfully lost no time in taking their crops from the land within the Langham school district.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Edward Koryto and the Hut Tax Rebels\n\nA more drastic way to keep the tax collector from your door is to \u003Cem>demolish your house\u003C/em>.\n\nMichigan factory worker Edward Koryto did that in 1971 to a home he had spent seven years building from scrap lumber, after tax assessors nearly tripled its assessed value, which raised the property taxes by 150%.\n\nIn Sierra Leone in 1898, collectors of a new five shilling “hut tax” found fewer huts than they expected:\n\n> In many cases the huts are not worth 5s, and when the tax collectors went round in January last many of the people knocked down their huts and slept under trees.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> American Quakers\n\nAmerican Quaker war tax resister and architect Robert E. Dickinson wrote a curious piece for the \u003Ci>Friends Journal\u003C/i>, accompanied by photos, about “My Tax Refusal Furniture”:\n\n> Like some other Friends, for several years I have refused to pay the war tax part of my telephone bills.\n> After notices and visits from representatives of the Internal Revenue Service, I was served with a notice for seizure of my property, including my furniture.\n>\n> This was all the inspiration I needed to design a basic set of furnishings that easily could be moved or disposed of.…\n>\n> When the authorities are at the door, the furniture can be demounted to flat slabs of plywood for ease in moving and storage.\n\nAmerican Quaker Wendal Bull resisted war taxes by keeping his income below the taxable level.\nBut in 1959 he received a large one-time payment that pushed him over the limit, so he had to get creative:\n\n> I distributed the unexpected income to various anti-war organizations.\n> I anticipated pressure from IRS officers, so in the autumn, long before the tax would be due, I disposed of all my attachable properties.\n> This action, under the circumstances, I believe to be unlawful.\n> But it seemed to me a mere technicality, far outweighed by the sin of paying for war, or the sin of permitting collection of the tax for that purpose.…\n\n> It is inconvenient to have no checking account, to own no real estate, to drive an old jalopy not worth attaching, and so on.\n> Some of us choose this alternative rather than to let the money be collected by distraint.\n\nThe IRS seized Paula Rogge’s car and auctioned it off to recover back taxes.\nAt first, her supporters tried to disrupt the auction by protesting it and by discouraging bidders, but a used car dealer eventually purchased the seized car.\nRogge explains what happened next:\n\n> A week following the auction, a doctor I had once worked with phoned and said that he wanted to buy the car back from the car dealer and donate it anonymously to our practice.\n> That was such a wonderful surprise.\n> I was very moved because I respected him very much as a doctor.\n> I talked the offer over with friends.\n> Though I didn’t want the money going, even indirectly, to the IRS, I did want this doctor to have an opportunity to support the whole cause of war tax resistance, and this was his way of contributing.\n> I decided to accept the car.\n> It came back with new tires, looking much cleaner than it had before it was seized!\n> A friend of the doctor had also done a tune-up on it—and it was great.\n> I think the best part of this story is that when I tell it, people chuckle.\n> You see, it’s such a good example of how limited the power of the IRS is in the face of creative resistance.\n> It’s also an example of how our needs are often met in unexpected ways when we take a stand for peace.\n\nBecause the donor gave the car to Rogge’s clinic rather than to Rogge, this meant that it was no longer an asset in Rogge’s name that the IRS could seize.\n\n\u003CAside type=\"tip\" title=\"See also\">\n[Disrupt Tax Auctions](../../../tacticsthatfrustratecountermeasures/disrupttaxauctions/)\n\u003C/Aside>\n\n\u003Chr

they can against people who work directly for it.\nCollaborators include people in other government agencies who take reprisals against resisters or who assist the tax bureaucracy in some way, witnesses who testify in court against resisters or who provide information to police or prosecutors, people who bid on seized goods that the government puts up for auction or who take jobs as auctioneers, people who provide services to or rent office space to tax officials, employees of repossession companies that contract with the government to seize property for back taxes, and so forth.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Fries and Whiskey Rebellions\n\nFor example, witnesses who were called to testify against the Fries Rebels “were generally very reluctant to give information, being afraid the insurgents would do them some injury.”\nDuring the Whiskey Rebellion, “William Richmond, who had given information against some of the rioters… had his barn burnt, with all the grain and hay which it contained…”\n\nJohn Lynn made the mistake of renting part of his house to the federal tax registrar of whiskey distilleries.\n\n> About twelve persons, armed and painted black… broke into the house of John Lynn, where the office was kept, and after having treacherously seduced him to come down stairs and put himself in their power, by a promise of safety to himself and his house, they seized and tied him, threatened to hang him, took him to a retired spot in a neighboring wood, and there, after cutting off his hair, tarring and feathering him, swore him never again to allow the use of his house for an office, never to disclose their names, and never again to have any sort of agency in aid of the excise; having done which, they bound him naked to a tree, and left him in that situation till morning, when he succeeded in extricating himself.\n> Not content with this, the malcontents some days after made him another visit, pulled down part of his house, and put him in a situation to be obliged to become an exile from his home, and to find an asylum elsewhere.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Rebecca Riots\n\nDuring the

Not one man in a hundred had the hardihood to declare himself the purchaser.\n\nIn order to take his tithes “in kind” from the farmers in his parish, one clergyman had to import some sixty workers “from distant counties, and at high wages, who yet were incapable of obtaining more than a small portion of tithes, being interrupted by a rabble—chiefly women—though men were lurking in the

notes like these:\n\n> “Government agents began at once to attempt tax collecting, but in most cases found the natives had departed from their lands.”\n\n> “The evaders lock their doors and flee when tax collectors appear, or hide in the fields…”\n\n> “…officials are arriving to post signs warning the peasants that their lands will be forfeit if they refuse to pay the dues.\n> Thus far they have found the villages deserted.”\n\nIn tax resistance hotbed Bardoli, some 55,000 peasants from the region (which had a total population of about 88,000 people) packed up and left, “taking everything movable, including the newly harvested rice crop, household goods, and cattle.”\nReports indicated “that the villagers had been secretly removing goods and crops by night across the border… where the Baroda villagers harboured and helped them.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The Monteverde Community\n\nIn 1950, seven American Quaker families left the United States and founded the community of Monteverde, Costa Rica.\nWrote one:\n\n> The reason [Quakers have come here] is not the climate, nor the possibility of finding work here, but rather an idealistic reason, typical of Quakers.\n> They were convinced that it was against their conscience to continue living in a country where, indirectly, they had to collaborate in arming the nation for war by means of taxation…\n\nBefore helping to found the community, Marvin Rockwell had been in prison for refusing to register for the military draft.\n“When the judge sentenced us, he said, ‘If you’re not willing to defend your country, you should get out.’\nSo we began to think seriously of that possibility,” he recalled.\n“We wanted to be free of paying taxes in a war economy.”\n\n## \u003CBadge

reorganization of my life.\n> I would have to emigrate, to become a “tax exile.”\n> It would not be right to benefit from the facilities and protection of my country while not paying my share…\n>\n> I made the decision to leave my own, my native land forever.\n. I would become a man without a country, separated by a vast ocean from friends, family and my young adult children.…\n>\n> I would owe allegiance to all of humanity and to no State.\n> I would be the indentured servant of no gang of murderers sitting in any legislative body.\n> By paying no tax to any State would I finally make a farewell to arms.\n> I would seek peace and brotherhood.\n\n##

campaign by appointing one of the resisters—a nonconformist named William Henry Clay—as the official rate collector.\nThe way the rate was collected, this made Clay financially responsible for the total amount of tax, and meant that resisters would be taking money out of his pockets, not the church’s.\nBut Clay was forewarned about the attempt.\n“Of course I did not regret that they had taken such a step,” he said, “because I thought it would be a good thing for our cause.\nThere is another clause in the Act that notice is to be served within 14 days, so I quietly took a trip to Ireland and other places till the 14 days expired.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* “Salt Raiding in India to be Ended” \u003Ci>Pittsburgh

Governor Evans\n\nIn one of the more amusing cases in my archive, American colonial Governor John Evans tried to impose a tax on shipping on the Delaware river.\nThis tax was not authorized by the colonial charter.\nEvans tried to enforce his pet tax by firing cannons on vessels that tried to pass his fort without paying.\n\nRichard Hill decided to defy the tax.\nFirst he sent men “with the ship’s papers to the fort, to show that the vessel had been regularly cleared at the custom-house, and to endeavour to persuade the officer to suffer her to pass without molestation,” but that didn’t work.\nThen he just tried to sail by, “steering as near to the opposite side as he safely could,” and almost got through unscathed “except [for] the main-sail, which was shot through.”\nThen:\n\n> The officer at the fort, not willing to miss his prize, immediately had his boat manned and went in pursuit.\n> [Hill’s] ship’s sails were now slackened, and the boat was allowed to come alongside, and having fastened a rope to the ship, the officer and his men came on board.\n> Whilst engaged in a warm controversy with the owner and his friends, some one on board (no doubt advisedly) quietly loosed the boat and let her drift astern.\n> The ship was now under full sail, and when the officer at length discovered that he was in danger of a voyage to the West Indies, and that all his hopes of retreat were cut off, his courage failed, and he suffered himself to be led as a prisoner into the cabin.\n\nHill landed on the Jersey side of the river, in a colony run by Evans’s rival-governor Lord Cornbury, “who claimed in his own right the exclusive jurisdiction of the river” and, being “a proud and haughty man, on hearing the case, was quite indignant at this encroachment on his prerogative, and he threatened the officer in no measured terms of rebuke, who now became seriously alarmed at his situation, and sued for pardon, making many professions of sorrow for the offence he had committed.\nAt length, having promised never to attempt the like again, he was suffered to depart.”\nEvans then gave up on his tax.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Railroad Bond

from '@astrojs/starlight/components';\n\nTax agencies thrive on bureaucracy and paperwork.\nMany of the earliest examples of writing in the worlds’ museums are tax records.\nSome mischievous tax resisters have discovered that this is a vulnerability that they can target.\n\nIn the United States, for example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) made a big shift toward computerized tax return filing and away from processing paper income tax returns that are filled out by hand.\nThis is more efficient for the agency, as it no longer has to hire as many people to laboriously transcribe the numbers from paper returns into its databases.\nThe agency once estimated that it costs about 35¢ on average to process an electronically-filed return, compared to an average of $2.87 for a paper return.\n\nThis suggests that one way resisters could make a dent in the agency’s budget and efficiency is simply by filing paper returns rather than filing electronically (this is still a legal option for individual filers, even for those who go to professional tax preparers).\n\nIf this tactic became widespread, it could cripple the tax collecting bureaucracy.\nGeorge Jakabcin, IRS assistant deputy associate chief information officer for systems integration, said in 2008 that the agency “would be in a world of hurt” if even half of the people who had switched to electronic filing at that time changed their minds and decided to switch back.\n\n> We no longer have the capability to process the additional 43 million returns manually.\n> We no longer have the facilities, we don’t have the IT infrastructure in place to support them, we don’t have the people, and some would argue that we are beginning to lose the expertise.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> American War Tax Resisters\n\nThe IRS has tried to crack down on people who send them paperwork just to waste their time.\nThey came up with something they call the “frivolous filing penalty” and they can ding filers for $5,000 each time they file any sort of paperwork that takes a position the agency considers to be “frivolous.”\nThe agency can assess this penalty immediately and on the whim of whichever bureaucrat is handling the case, without going to court, and the victim is only allowed to appeal the fine before a judge if he or she pays it first!\n\nWar tax resister Karl Meyer wasn’t about to let the IRS think it could intimidate him that way.\nIn 1984, at the height of the “Cabbage Patch Kids” craze (each doll slightly different), he invented what he called “cabbage patch resistance”—filing a different, blatantly “frivolous” tax return \u003Cem>every day\u003C/em>, “addressed to a different employee or office of the IRS.”\nHe was assessed $140,000 in penalties in 1984 alone (though the penalty per frivolous return was only $500 back then).\nThe IRS never has collected that money.\nThe best it could manage was to seize and sell Meyer’s car, for a little over $1,000.\n\nWar tax resister Ed Hedemann has already made plans for what he calls “zombie war tax resistance.”\nHe has filled in years of tax returns ahead of time and put them in pre-stamped envelopes so that his survivors can continue to file (but, of course, refuse to pay!) after he’s dead and gone.\n“Why give the government a break from having to deal with your resistance when you die?” he asks.\n\nHedemann also makes a point of periodically filing Freedom of Information Act requests for any information the IRS and other government agencies have been collecting about his activities—hundreds of pages, as it turns out—and he’s put together a guide for other tax resisters to follow in making their own requests.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> American Constitutionalists\n\n“Constitutionalist” and “sovereign citizen”-style tax protest groups in the United States are fond of harassing tax officials and other government employees with lawsuits, liens, bogus quasi-official court filings, and other such paperwork.\nIn one example, Eddie Kahn’s “Guiding Light of God Ministries” filed some 2,000 misconduct complaints against IRS agents.\nA newspaper article about a subsequent legal case against the group noted that:\n\n> Some agents have said that their supervisors ordered them to back off from audits or collection efforts in the face of [such] threats, just to avoid investigations by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Hacking the Tax Agency\n\nOther paperwork tricks are more like “hacking” in that they treat the tax agency as a system that processes input and produces output, and note that certain examples of pathological input can result in output that was not anticipated by the system designers.\nFor example, the IRS mistakenly gave away twenty million dollars in the 2008 filing season when crafty people figured out that if they substantially \u003Cem>overpaid\u003C/em> their taxes with a bad check, the IRS would cut them a hefty refund check before they noticed they’d been had.\n\nThere is an ongoing epidemic of “identity theft” tax fraud in the United States in which fraudsters file for phony tax refunds in the names of other, real people.\nThis often causes the tax collection bureaucracy to swing into action against the \u003Cem>victims\u003C/em> of the identity theft—once the IRS figures out it’s been swindled—which is both a waste of resources and a way of further alienating the population from the government and its tax agency.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Alliance of the Libertarian Left\n\nSouth Carolina’s state government passed a law that required all organizations that “directly or indirectly advocate, advise, teach, or practice the duty or necessity of controlling, seizing, or overthrowing the government of the United States, the state of South Carolina, or any political division thereof,” to register their activities with the South Carolina Secretary of State and to pay a five-dollar filing fee.\nA member of the Alliance of the Libertarian Left decided to register, but with a twist:\n\n> When belligerence and inhumanity prevail, the peaceful and the humane must find honor in being categorized as the enemies of the prevailing order.\n> Please keep me updated as to the status of our registration.\n> I look forward to hearing back from you as to our official recognition as enemies of your state and its government.…\n>\n> P.S. I am told that there is a processing fee in the amount of $5.00 for the registration of a subversive organization.\n> Our organization is in fact so dastardly that we have refused to remit the fee.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Prussian Farmers\n\nPrussian farmers in 1922 used the bureaucracy against itself.\nA \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> report noted:\n\n> They have all filed protests and demanded that they be relieved from paying the tax until the protests are settled.\n> That means a delay of at least three years in collecting the taxes, and it is said that the Provincial Treasury is inclined to grant this request.\n> The big agrarians declared that they would do the same thing with all the tax laws.\n> In Berlin the people might decree what pleased them, they (the agrarians) would not pay the taxes or subscribe to the compulsory loans.\n> They want to sabotage the whole taxation system that they hate, and consequently they want to make so much work for the Treasury officers that the latter don’t know which way to turn.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nAn early form of resistance to Thatcher’s poll tax was called the “send it back” campaign.\nPeople were advised to send in their registration forms for the tax, as the law required, but to accompany them with questions that would require further manual processing by the councils that were processing the registrations:\n\n> Government regulations state: “…if for any reason you consider that you are not a ‘responsible person’ please let me know and return the form to me without completing it.”\n>\n> [The anti-poll tax campaign called] Stop It wants people to take up this offer by writing to ask if they should be the “responsible person” and suggests they ask who will have access to the information supplied and why the authorities require exact dates of birth.…\n>\n> Labour MP Brian Wilson, chairman of Stop It, said: “It is a campaign of obstruction within the law that does not lead people to incur the substantial penalties that are built into the legislation.”\n> The aim was to have the legislation amended or abandoned.\n\nFor this and other reasons, the councils were inundated with paperwork.\n“Councils sat under a mountain of paper.\nEverything they did seemed to create more work,” wrote campaign historian Danny Burns.\nHe quotes from the Poll Tax Legal Group:\n\n> The paperwork involved with administering the charge is enormous—and likely to get worse.\n> Backlogs switch from one area of activity to another.\n> Indeed, local authorities cannot really do anything without generating more paperwork.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Chicago Property Tax Strike\n\nThe Association of Real Estate Taxpayers in Chicago during the Great Depression led tens of thousands of property owners to demand reassessments of their property.\nThis swamped the Board of Review and allowed the property owners to legally delay tax payment.\nWhen the Association filed a lawsuit, they did so in the form of gigantic, 7,000-page, two-foot-thick book volumes that listed each of the 26,000 co-litigants in the suit along with their assessments, tax bills, and the locations of their property.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* “Repeated Efforts to Modernize Paper Tax Return Processing Have Been Unsuccessful;

It is high treason to pay taxes. Refusal to pay taxes is the primary duty of the citizen!”\n\nThe government took Marx to court for such incitements to rebellion, but this didn’t discourage him.\nMarx, defending himself, managed to persuade the jury that he’d been right all along.\n(Edmund Wilson, in whose book \u003Ci>To the Finland Station\u003C/i> I first learned about this case, wrote that “the effect on the jury was so great that Marx was thanked on their behalf by the foreman for his ‘extremely informative speech.’”)\n\nThe prosecution had tried to paint Marx’s advocacy of tax refusal as an act of revolutionary rebellion.\nBecause of this, Marx felt that his acquittal not only justified tax resistance but also total revolt:\n\n> [T]he case turned only on the political question: whether the accused were authorised by the decision of the National Assembly on the refusal to pay taxes to call in this way for resistance to the state power, to organise an armed force against that of the state, and to have government authorities removed and appointed at their discretion.\n>\n> After a very brief consultation, the jury answered this question in the \u003Cem>affirmative\u003C/em>.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> The Whiskey Rebellion\n\nDuring the passive resistance in Kentucky that paralleled the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania, juries had no interest in indicting or convicting people for their refusal to pay federal excise tax on distilled spirits.\nHistorian Mary K. Bonsteel Tachau wrote of how this effectively made the tax a dead letter:\n\n> In fact, the only action taken by grand juries during the first four years was to approve the first census.\n> Their inactivity implied that Kentucky was a notably law-abiding place.\n>\n> Of course the judge, the marshal, the grand jurors, and everybody else in Kentucky knew that the internal revenue laws were being ignored.\n> The \u003Ci>Kentucky Gazette\u003C/i> regularly published notices about the statutes, often accompanied by complaints and threats from Colonel Marshall.\n> It is possible that the grand jurors felt justified in overlooking their obligation by attending strictly to the instructions that Judge Innes gave them.\n> He regularly delivered eloquent addresses describing the matters that came within their cognizance…\n> These were sometimes lengthy lists, but they had one obvious omission because violation of federal statutes was also within the grand jurors’ purview.\n> As long as the judge overlooked such widespread evasion, the jurors evidently felt no obligation to take the initiative and bring charges against their neighbors.\n\nFederal prosecutors could themselves have brought charges against tax resisters before these grand juries, but none of them tried.\nIndeed the federal government had difficulty finding anyone to take the job of prosecutor.\nWhen, five and a half years after the excise tax went into effect, they finally found someone to take the job, he was a recent arrival from out of state, and they had “to furnish [him] with copies of the revenue statutes, because none were available in the commonwealth.”\n\nThe government could now begin bringing charges against Whiskey Rebels in Kentucky.\nBut it would not be easy:\n\n> During the remaining terms of court in 1797, the federal marshal failed to convene grand juries, and [federal prosecutor] Clarke failed to file any informations [charges].\n> Clarke had run head-on against the power structure, and it was not about to submit tamely to an outsider.\n> The agents that he had instructed to seize [Thomas] Jones’s stills were charged with trespass; the witnesses whom he had summoned to testify to the grand juries were denied compensation for their travel.\n> Clarke complained to the treasury department, which initially sympathized with him, but it acknowledged that the judge was master in his own court.\n\nMore than seven years after the excise tax came into effect, the government decided to change the rules:\nwhiskey distillers would henceforth be banned from serving on the grand jury!\nOne of the bottlenecks to prosecution had been broken through.\nBut the government still had to convince trial juries to convict:\n\n> [A]s these cases came to trial, it became clear that the distillers did not have much to worry about.\n> In an early grand jury address, Judge Innes had stated that “trials by jury… are the great bulwark which intervenes between the magistrate and the citizen,” and these petit jurors obviously saw themselves as that great bulwark.\n> Whether the charges were initiated by Clarke or by revenue collectors or by grand juries made no difference:\n> trial jurors regularly acquitted their neighbors of criminal charges.\n> In Kentucky, violation of the revenue acts was simply not perceived as a crime.\n> \u003Cem>Not one of the fifty criminal charges brought during the four years of Clarke’s tenure resulted in conviction\u003C/em> [emphasis mine].…\n> Seven cases went to trial, but the jurors found for the defendants every time, and the judge then ordered their accusers to pay the costs of the suits.\n\nIt proved impossible to win convictions—and it is easy to see why:\nThe law was held in contempt by the people the juries were being drawn from.\nBonsteel Tachau notes, for instance, that “[i]n one term of court alone, five members of the jury panels were themselves defendants in cases brought by Clarke.”\n\nThe successful resistance by people in Kentucky against attempts to prosecute tax resisters continued until the tax resistance movement could claim victory with the election of president Thomas Jefferson, who promised to rescind the tax.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Rebecca Riots\n\nDuring one of the tollgate destructions that marked the Rebecca Riots in Wales, a woman who was in charge of the toll house rushed back to try to save it from the flames.\nShe was shot and killed, presumably by one of the Rebeccaites.\n\n> [A]n inquest was held… on the body were marks of shot, some penetrating the nipple of left breast, one in the armpit of the same side, and several shot marks on both arms.\n> On the external end of the left clavicle there were two shot-marks, one on the left side of the windpipe.\n> There were several on the forehead, and on the external angle of the right eye.\n> Two shots were found in the left lung.\n> In spite of all this, the jury found “that the deceased died from effusion of blood into the chest, which occasioned suffocation, but from what cause is to this jury unknown”!!!\n\nBecause the inquest refused to find the cause of death to be homicide, even in the face of such clear evidence, it was difficult for the government to launch an investigation, make arrests, or begin a prosecution.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Colonial Connecticut\n\nA government may try to counteract the threat of jury nullification by transporting defendants to a more sympathetic jurisdiction, or it may try to hand-pick a “hanging jury” to ensure conviction, but either of these gambits risks further alienating people and bolstering the credibility of the resisters’ arguments about the faithlessness and illegitimacy of the government (and therefore about the need to resist its taxes).\n\nFor example, the governor of colonial Connecticut put members of the Ipswich town meeting on trial after they refused to assess taxes the governor had tried to impose without the consent of the colonial Assembly.\nThe trial was a sham—the jury was hand-picked by the prosecution, and the judge referred to the defendants as “criminals” throughout the course of the trial and told them they “must not think the privileges of English men would follow [them] to the end of the world.”\n\nBut that is exactly what the resisters did think, and when, enraged by this sort of tyranny, they overthrew the colonial government, they threw that quote back in the faces of the governor and the judge and imprisoned both of them.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Marx, Karl “No Tax Payments!” \u003Ci>Neue Rheinische Zeitung\u003C/i> No. 145, 17 November 1848 (special

‘voluntarily,’ we’ll seize your property instead.”\n\nSome tax resisters respond by taunting back: “you’ll have to find it first.”\nOne way they have made good on this is by arranging for other people to hold the resisters’ property in their names.\n\nFor example, some war tax resistance “alternative funds,” into which resisters pay their taxes rather than submitting them to the government, have a dual purpose:\nthey redirect tax money to causes the resisters find more palatable than military expenses, and they form a fund that, although it is not officially in their names, resisters can later reclaim if the government succeeds in seizing taxes from them.\n\n\u003CAside type=\"tip\" title=\"See also\">\n[Redirect Resisted Taxes to

Munshi reported back to the government after visiting Bardoli:\n\n> Your \u003Ci>japti\u003C/i> officer has to travel miles before he can get a shave.\n> Your officer’s car which got stuck would have remained in the mud but for Mr. Vallabhbhai, officially styled “agitator living on Bardoli.”\n> Garda to whom lands worth thousands have been sold for a nominal amount does not get even a scavenger for his house.\n> The Collector gets no conveyance on the railway station unless one is given by Mr. Vallabhbhai’s sanction.\n\nThe threat of social boycott also played out at other points in the Indian independence struggle.\nFor instance, an account of the Dharasana salt raid noted that “the native police, fearing social boycott if they pressed their own kinsmen too hard, in some cases sat idly by and watched proceedings.”\n\nWhen the salt march was approaching the sea, where Gandhi planned to harvest sea salt in circumvention of the taxed salt monopoly, the government sent police and hired hundreds of other people to go there and try to thwart his plans.\nHowever:\n\n> The police and labourers are boycotted by the villagers in the neighbourhood and have to journey to a village ten

in a cause he himself must feel just?\n\n> The cabman who brought the officers, seeing they were engaged in such a disagreeable duty, took his cab away, and they had some difficulty in procuring

way.\nFaraway bureaucrats shuffle numbers in spreadsheets.\nComputers send letters.\nBut tax collectors and assessors have sometimes had to scrape some shoe leather to get the job done, and this has been another opportunity for the resisters.\nOne way tax resisters can foil the plans of the tax collectors is to send up the alarm when they’re on the way.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Annuity Tax Resistance\n\n“Horning” was a legal term describing the process by which tax debtors could be imprisoned for defying the King (it was normally prohibited at the time to imprison someone merely for being a debtor in default).\nDuring the Edinburgh Annuity Tax resistance, one victim of this process declared “Horning! horning!—by the powers! if they bring a \u003Cem>horning\u003C/em> against me, I’ll bring a horning against them”:\n\n> When the King’s messenger-at-arms, as tipstaves are called in Scotland, brought his \u003Cem>horning\u003C/em> to the

“Union for the Defence of Shopkeepers and Craftsmen”:\n\n> The loudspeaker is its symbol and it all started in earnest one bright morning 18 months ago when a loudspeaker mounted on a truck brought awful tidings to the pleasant little town of St. Cere near Toulouse in south-west France.\n>\n> “Attention,” it blared.\n> “Attention.\n> The tax inspector is in town.”\n>\n> There was a rumbling sound as the steel curtains with which French shops are shuttered at night were rolled down all over St. Cere.…\n>\n> The tax inspector rapped on steel curtain after steel curtain, demanding to be let in to see the books.\n> Nowhere did he get an answer.\n> When they found that even the bistros were locked, the hapless inspector and his guards gave up their mission and beat a humble retreat from St. Cere.\n>\n> The triumph of St. Cere lit the fires of rebellion in the hearts of tax-ridden shopkeepers all over France.\n> Poujade was suddenly a national figure and he lost no time in organizing his Union to spread the message of the loudspeakers and the steel curtains.\n\nIn addition, according to another article on the movement, “some priests ring church bells to warn of the arrival of the revenuers.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Greek “Won’t Pay” Movement\n\nWhen tax official Nikos Maitos took a team of inspectors to the island of Naxos to hunt for tax evaders,

help is needed.\nPeasants ran from all sides towards the smoke.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nDuring the Bardoli satyagraha, tax collectors and other government enforcers were shadowed by resisters, who warned villagers they were coming.\nResister Govardhandas Chokhavala said, “We have provided our volunteers with drums and conches, and the moment they sight a Government servant, the drum or the conch gives the alarm.\nThat is work which is after the heart of these youngsters.”\nSome other notes from \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i>

[attachment] depredations.\n\n> The youngsters on duty announced [the Collector’s] arrival by a hearty beating of their drums, and all the doors were closed.\n\n> Some [resisters] had to post themselves at and keep a strict watch over the various approaches to the village, and no sooner was a \u003Ci>japti\u003C/i> party sighted or the whank of a car heard, than they were to be on their alert, and the warning of the fact to be given to the village people.\n> Some of them had always like sleuth hounds to be on the trail of the Government officials.\n> Their business was to scent their plans and warn the village people against their machinations.\n\nThe government found this tactic so frustrating that at one point it “prohibited the beating of drums, playing music, or blowing conches or horns on or near public roads or public places or Government buildings.”\nSome boys were arrested, tried, and imprisoned for nothing more than keeping a watchful eye on a government building from across the street.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Meo Rebellion\n\nTax resisters in Alwar, India in 1932 used this system:\n“The paths are blocked by huge boulders

Talog; but when on their way there they heard the sound of a horn, and immediately between two and three hundred persons assembled together, with their faces blackened, some dressed in women’s caps, and others with their coats turned so as to be completely disguised—armed with scythes, crowbars and all manner of destructive weapons which they could lay their hands on.\n> After cheering the constables, they defied them to do their duty.\n> The latter had no alternative but to return to town without executing their warrants.\n>\n> The women were seen running in all directions to alarm their neighbours; and some hundreds were concealed behind the hedges, intending to appear if their services were required.\n> The entire district seemed to be aroused, and awaiting the arrival of the constables, who were going to levy on the goods of John Harris of Talog Mill for the amount of the fine and costs imposed upon him by the magistrates.\n> There could not have been less than two hundred persons assembled to resist the execution of process, and vast numbers were flocking from all quarters, in response to the blowing of a horn, the signal of the Rebeccaites to repair thither.\n> Various mounted messengers were scouring the country and sounding the trumpet of alarm.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nDuring the poll tax rebellion in Thatcher’s Britain, resisters tracked and shadowed bailiffs, and declared certain areas to be bailiff “no-go” zones, establishing look-outs to raise the alarm if any bailiffs dared to approach.\nThe campaign modeled this approach on tactics used in South African townships during the anti-apartheid resistance there, and then customized the tactic for their local conditions:\n\n> Throughout Britain, city-wide bailiff busting groups were formed.\n> Activists in Edinburgh formed a group called “Scum-busters” which was equipped with CB radios and squadrons of cars.\n> Telephone trees were organised; bailiff companies were monitored; their car registration numbers were taken and distributed to activists in all the local areas.\n> Camden, in London, followed their example in 1991:\n>\n> > We have organised a rota so that we know who and when people are available to do whatever shift.\n> > We have organised a “knock up system” giving people different responsibilities for knocking up each part of the estate when the bailiffs are spotted.\n> > Telephone trees have also been established.\n> > We have approached a couple of mini-cab firms who have agreed to be bailiff spotters.…\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Dublin Water Charge Strike\n\nAn activist in the Dublin water charge strike remembered what happened when the government threatened to cut off water services to resisters in December, 1994:\n\n> All the activists raced into action.\n> There were stake-outs at the water inspectors’ houses.\n> We would follow them around to ensure that they didn’t attempt any cut off under the cover of the night.\n> Clondalkin people organised their own cars to patrol around that area.\n> CB radios were installed in the cars so that we were in constant communication with each other as we monitored the movements of the men who would try to cut people’s water off.\n> One house in Tallaght was turned into a virtual Head Quarters for the campaign.\n> The phone calls kept flooding in.\n> Communities learned to be vigilant of the blue Dublin Water Works vans and were very wary when they came into the estates.\n> Children playing football on the park were told to knock on the doors when they saw such vans in the area.\n> Indeed one van ventured into an estate in Clondalkin village and when the kids alerted everyone to their

political factions throw rhetoric across the room in angry and unproductive exchanges.\n> Essentially, boring meetings which stretch long into the night.\n> Hundreds of thousands of people have been to these meetings just once and never returned.\n> To engage people in a mass campaign, the Anti-Poll Tax Unions had to challenge this culture of organisation.\n> They had to make people feel wanted and included and give everyone a sense that they had a role.…\n> This immediate form of organisation also meant that people weren’t patronised by those who had political experience.\n> In the local groups, people didn’t need permission to act, they just had to get on the phone to their neighbours and get something going.\n> People stay involved in political campaigns if they can contribute in the way that they feel is most effective.\n\nHowever, he also notes:\n\n> …it was sometimes in the places where the Anti-Poll Tax Unions were weakest that resistance was strongest.\n> For example, St. Pauls was almost the only area in Bristol which couldn’t sustain an Anti-Poll Tax group.\n> Local people didn’t feel the need to set up new groups because, as in many inner city areas, they already had strong networks of solidarity, and there was already a high level of general hostility to officials of any sort.…\n> By the end of 1990, three times as many people had turned up to court to contest their cases from St. Pauls than any other area.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* “History of Europe: Chapter VIII—France” \u003Ci>The

of their employees.\nHere are some that have come to my attention:\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Kenyan Democracy Movement\n\nCharles Kanjama anticipated a short tax resistance campaign to pressure the Kenyan government to enact democratic reforms and to invalidate the sham presidential election of 2008.\nSo, rather than refusing outright to pay taxes, he suggested that more timid tax refusers could quietly restructure the terms of their employment:\n“participating employers and employees can enter into a voluntary contract to convert monthly employment into quarterly or half-yearly employment, thus effectively delaying tax liability for several months.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Catholic Worker\n\nThe Catholic Worker movement had a fail-safe strategy for supporting the tax resistance of its employees.\nDorothy Day wrote:\n“The C.W. has never paid salaries.\nEveryone gets board, room, and clothes (tuition, recreation included, as the C.W. is in a way a school of living).\nSo we do not need to pay federal income taxes.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> \u003Ci>The Other Side\u003C/i>\n\nAn employer does not have to eliminate salaries entirely to facilitate tax resistance—just keeping salaries sufficiently low can help.\nThe Christian activist magazine \u003Ci>The Other Side\u003C/i>, which was published between 1965 and 2005, did this.\nStaff member Dee Dee Risher explained:\n“We’ve built into our workplace certain small disciplines to remind ourselves that we are on this path of conversion.\nOur salaries are structured to allow staff members to do war tax resistance and are intentionally low to remind us of the struggles of the poor and sharpen our willingness to sacrifice.”\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> War Tax Resisters\n\nWhen war tax resister Steve Soucy told his employer that he would have to quit his job if the IRS began to attach his salary, his employer agreed to reduce his hours, and therefore his salary, below the level that the IRS would attach (IRS policy allows even people with tax debts to have some minimum amount of take-home pay).\n“I eventually tapered my hours from the maximum allowed before withholding to just a few hours per week,” Soucy says, “while increasing my employment in my other jobs to cover the loss in income and benefits.\nThe most rewarding part was talking to my co-workers, whom I found quite sympathetic to my reasons for tax resistance.\nIn a way it was like coming ‘out of the closet,’ and gave them the opportunity to be supportive.”\n\nAnother American war tax resister reported:\n“Rent is always my biggest expense and thus the biggest burden on my practice of war tax resistance.\nUsually, I try to arrange housing as a component of one of my jobs.\nBy doing this, I significantly reduce the amount of cash I need to earn.\nI currently work as the caretaker of buildings and grounds at a camp for people with disabilities.\nThe camp provides me with a residence on the premises so I can keep watch over the facility and so I can be available on short notice for critical maintenance needs.\nAlthough our arrangement is a barter of services in exchange for housing, the value of this particular type of barter is excluded from my income under the Internal Revenue Code.”\n\nA woman who worked for the gambling bookmaker William Hill asked her employer to stop withholding taxes from her, on the grounds that under international law it would be illegal for her to pay for war crimes being committed by the government.\nShe describes what happened next:\n\n> [T]o my amazement, I got a response inviting me to a meeting with the area manager and a chap from Personnel, and we sat down and we discussed the legal implications of paying tax to the U.K. government.\n> And of course they raised all the normal concerns about the legality of not paying tax, and they showed us a copy of a letter that they had received from the Inland Revenue—so William Hill actually wrote to the Inland Revenue, bringing this matter up, and got a response!\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Voices in the Wilderness\n\nCorporations can also refuse to pay taxes or other requisitions that they themselves owe.\nFor example, in 2005 the activist group “Voices in the Wilderness” was fined $20,000 for bringing food and medicine into Iraq when that country was under a blockade.\nThey refused to pay, saying:\n\n> Voices will not pay a penny of this fine.…\n> We chose to travel to Iraq in order to openly challenge our country’s war against the Iraqi people.\n> We fully understood that our acts could result in criminal or civil charges.\n> We acted because when our country’s government is committing a grievous, criminal act, it is incumbent upon each of us to challenge in every nonviolent manner possible the acts of the government….\n> \n> We choose to continue our noncooperation with the government’s war on the Iraqi people through the simple act of refusing to pay this fine.\n> To pay the fine would be to collaborate with the U.S. government’s ongoing war against Iraq.\n> We will not collaborate.\n\nAnd many Quaker organizations and congregations in the United States began resisting the federal excise tax on their office phones during the Vietnam War.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Alas, the \u003Ci>East Africa Standard\u003C/i> article that contained this Kanjama quote evaporated from

Whipple was imprisoned for refusing to pay a militia tax, an anonymous donor eventually paid the tax (and added costs) to have him released:\n\n> At an unexpected moment an entire stranger called at the prison and desired to know the amount of the tax and costs, which he paid, saying he knew the worth of Z.C. Whipple, and that his family for generations back had never paid the military tax, and he wished to save the State from the disgrace of imprisoning a person guilty of no crime.\n> The money was paid and the door opened, and his friend took the receipt to his children and said, “Keep this as a reminiscence that in 1874 your father paid this bill to release a young man from prison, that he might enjoy the rights of conscience.”\n\n## When Paying a Resister’s Fines is No Help\n\nIf a resister refuses to pay a tax or fine as an act of principled civil disobedience, if you were to pay the money on their behalf they might see this as \u003Cem>interference\u003C/em> rather than support.\n\n### \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" /> Henry David Thoreau\n\nThe trick to supporting imprisoned tax resisters is to respect their real needs and desires.\nWhen “someone interfered,” as Henry David Thoreau put it, and paid his taxes for him in order to spring him from his night in jail, they thought wrongly that they were doing Thoreau a favor, “for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other side of that stone wall” whereas for Thoreau, the inside \u003Cem>was\u003C/em> the right side:\n\n> Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.…\n>\n> I saw that, if there was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen, there was a still more difficult one to climb or break through, before they could get to be as free as I was.\n> I did not for a moment feel confined, and the walls seemed a great waste of stone and mortar.\n\n### \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" /> Sylvia Hardy\n\nSylvia Hardy was upset that the annual cost of living increase in her pension was less than 3%, while her council tax was rising by a double-digit percentage each year.\nSo she decided to stop paying.\nA misguided sympathizer paid her bill for her one year, and in response Hardy wrote to the council to ask them not to accept any further donations in her name.\nContinued refusal, she felt, was “the only way to get our voices heard.”\n\n### \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" /> Mary McLeod Cleeves\n\nWhen women’s suffrage activist Mary McLeod Cleeves was threatened with imprisonment for refusing to pay a carriage license tax, the suffragist newspaper \u003Ci>The Vote\u003C/i> noted that “Mrs. Cleeves has been besieged by friends asking to be allowed to pay her fine; but like a true Suffragette, she refused.”\n\n### \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" /> Annuity Tax Resisters\n\nPaying fines or taxes on behalf of a conscientious resister can send the wrong message.\nQuakers were largely in sympathy with the Annuity Tax resisters of Edinburgh, Scotland, in the mid-nineteenth century, but an editorial in one Quaker periodical chided those resisters for having taken up a collection to pay to get their colleagues out of jail, rather than embracing martyrdom like a good Quaker would:\n\n> Did it not occur to the Dissenters of Edinburgh, that it was not from want of \u003Cem>pecuniary ability\u003C/em> that either of the prisoners allowed himself to be immured in jail?\n> Or again, what was the difference between these individuals paying the tax themselves, and its being paid \u003Cem>for them\u003C/em> by public subscription?\n> If it was wrong in the one case, it must be equally wrong, and a violation of principle, in the other.\n> It has surprised us that not one of the Dissenting Journals that we have met with has taken this view of the subject.\n> In their joyfulness at the liberation of the prisoners, they seem to have lost sight entirely of the \u003Cem>sacrifice of principle\u003C/em> at which it was obtained.\n\n### \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" /> Juanita Nelson\n\nAmerican war tax resister Juanita Nelson was arrested one morning for contempt of court (she refused to provide records to the IRS) and was hauled off to jail in her bathrobe.\nShe explains how she accommodated her friends’ desires to help, while remaining faithful to her principles:\n\n> [W]hen the deputy interrupted my reverie to announce visitors, whom I could see in the waiting room, I told him I would leave only to be released.…\n> \n> Two fellow pacifists, one of them also a tax refuser, had been permitted to come to me, since I would not go to them.\n> I asked them what was uppermost in my mind, what they’d do about getting properly dressed?\n> They said that this was something I would have to settle for myself.\n> I sensed that they thought it the better part of wisdom and modesty for me to be dressed for my appearance in court.\n> They were more concerned about the public relations aspect of getting across the witness than I was.\n> They were also genuinely concerned, I knew, about making their actions truly nonviolent, cognizant of the other person’s feelings, attitudes, and readiness.\n> I was shaken enough to concede that I would like to have my clothes at hand, in case I decided I would feel more at ease in them.\n> The older visitor, a dignified man with white hair, agreed to go for the clothes in a taxicab.\n>\n> They left, and on their heels came another visitor.\n> She had been told that in permitting her to come up, the officials were treating me with more courtesy than I was according them.\n> It was her assessment that the chief deputy was hopeful that someone would be able to hammer some sense into me and was willing to make concessions in that hope.\n> But he had misjudged the reliance he might place in her—she was not as critical as the men.\n> She did not know what she would do, but she thought she might wish to have the strength and the audacity to carry through in the vein in which I had started.\n>\n> And she said. “You know, you look like a female Gandhi in that robe. You look, well, dignified.”\n>\n> That was my first encouragement.\n> Everyone else had tended to make me feel like a fool of the first water, had confirmed fears I already had on that score.\n> My respect and admiration for Gandhi, though not uncritical, was deep.\n> And if I in any way resembled him in appearance I was prepared to try to emulate a more becoming state of mind.\n> I reminded myself, too, that I had on considerably more than the loincloth in which Gandhi was able to greet kings and statesmen with ease.\n> I need not be unduly perturbed about wearing a robe into the presence of his honor.\n\n![licensed from “Icebar1” under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license](../../../assets/juanita-nelson.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>Juanita Nelson in front of her Deerfield, Massachusetts home\u003C/figcaption>\n\nNelson decided not to contribute to the pretense of courtroom dignity by changing clothes.\nShe appeared before the judge in the same bathrobe she’d been arrested in.\n(The government later dropped the contempt charge against her, without explanation.)\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* “A Recent Imprisonment in Connecticut” \u003Ci>The British Friend\u003C/i> 1 February 1875, p. 33\n* Thoreau, Henry David [“Resistance to Civil Government”](https://sniggle.net/TPL/index5.php?entry=rtcg) (1849)\n* “Pensioner prepared to go to jail” \u003Ci>BBC News\u003C/i> 20 June 2005\n* “‘Terrified’ pensioner jailed over £53 tax bill” \u003Ci>Daily Mail\u003C/i> 26 September 2005\n* Sidley, Marguerite A. “Welsh Campaign” \u003Ci>The Vote\u003C/i> 29 October 1910, p. 5\n* “Baillie Stott, and the Edinburgh Annuity Tax” \u003Ci>The British Friend\u003C/i> 31 August 1848, p. 210\n* Nelson, Juanita “A Matter of Freedom” in \u003Ci>We Won’t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader\u003C/i> (2008) pp. 451–461.\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/docs/tacticsthatsupportresisters/paytheirfines.mdx","1ae785d272ffe7a7","tacticsthatsupportresisters/petitionforleniency",{"id":1277,"data":1279,"body":1285,"filePath":1286,"digest":1287,"deferredRender":16},{"title":1280,"description":1281,"editUrl":16,"head":1282,"template":52,"sidebar":1283,"pagefind":16,"draft":39},"Petition for Leniency towards Resisters","Try to convince the government to be lenient toward resisters.",[],{"order":714,"hidden":39,"attrs":1284},{},"import { Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';\n\nSome campaigns have supported tax resisters by trying to convince the government to be lenient toward them.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Quakers\n\nWhen a number of young Quaker men were imprisoned for failure to pay a militia exemption tax in 1778, David Cooper followed them to jail and met with the officers who were holding them captive.\nHe wrote:\n\n> I had much conversation with them; they appeared very moderate, but were very earnest for me to pay the fine, and not suffer our sons to be committed to prison.\n> I told them they were aware that our religious principles forbade it; the young men were in their possession, and I had no desire to persuade them to deviate from what they believed their duty as officers required; but only wished them to use their power in a manner that would afford peace hereafter.\n> It was a matter of conscience; they ought therefore to be very tender, and not use rigor…\n> They appeared friendly, and the young men being under the Sheriff’s care, he directed them to go home, and meet him at Woodbury at an appointed day.\n> He afterwards sent them word they need give themselves no further trouble till he called for them.\n> So the matter rested.\n\n## \u003CBadge text=\"Example\" size=\"medium\" /> Regulators\n\nAnother possibility is to try to legally rehabilitate convicted resisters after the fact.\nDuring the American Revolution, one of the first items on the agenda of the North Carolina revolutionary Convention in August, 1775, was to ensure that the new revolutionary regime would rescind the legal penalties forced on the earlier Regulator tax rebels:\n\n> Resolved: That the late Insurgents and every of them, ought to be protected from every attempt to punish them by any means whatsoever, and that this Congress will, to their utmost, protect them from any injury to their persons or property which may be attempted on the pretence of punishing the said late insurrection, or anything in consequence thereof.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Cooper, David “It Was a Matter of Conscience” \u003Ci>American Quaker War Tax Resistance\u003C/i>, 2nd. ed.

In refusing, the Meeting will set forth its belief that military tax resistance is an appropriate individual expression of the Friends Peace Testimony and that Yearly Meeting is led, consistent with its most fundamental beliefs, to resist government efforts to coerce an employee against their conscience in such historic Friends’ testimonies.\n\nSuch a policy exposes the organization and its officers to possible government reprisals, and in effect makes the corporate body itself a tax resister.\nAn organization that wants to make such a stand must decide, just as an individual must, how far they are willing to go.\nWhen the IRS tried to levy the salary of war tax resister Vinton Deming, who was the editor of the \u003Ci>Friends Journal\u003C/i> (which is associated with the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Quakers), the Journal resisted at first, but finally relinquished the money when their legal advisor told them they had no chance of prevailing in court.\n\n## Sojourners\n\nThe Christian activist group Sojourners has a policy of refusing to comply with government levies of the salaries of its employees who are war tax resisters.\nSojourners managing director Joe Roos says:\n“To date we have been threatened with levies, with the confiscation of our property, with arrest and prison terms, and, most recently, with the money we refused to turn over being taken out of my personal account since the IRS views me as a ‘responsible person.’\nDespite all these threats, the only action they have taken is to levy our corporate account, taking the amount they say is still due plus interest, plus penalty.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Igou, Brad “Valentine Byler vs. the IRS: ‘Pay Unto Caesar—The Amish & Social Security’” \u003Ci>Amish Country News\u003C/i> 1999, 2005\n* “Policy on Military Tax Refusal by Philadelphia Yearly Meeting Employees and on IRS Levies and Other Collection Efforts,” approved by the meeting in 1988 (reaffirming a practice established in 1975), and revised in 2010\n* “Magazine to Pay IRS” \u003Ci>Reading Eagle\u003C/i> 25 April 1992, p.

the tax along with all of the other charges in a unified phone bill.\nFor this reason, some phone companies would treat phone tax resisters as though they were underpaying their phone bills instead of recognizing that they were refusing to pay only the tax—and the companies would sometimes incorrectly add late-fees or threaten to cut off service.\n\nThe [HangUpOnWar](https://nwtrcc.org/programs-events/hang-up-on-war/) website collected stories from phone tax resisters about their experiences with a variety of phone service providers.\nThese stories made it easier for resisters to determine which department they should call to get a bill sorted out, whether resisters would have more luck if they accompanied their phone bills with a letter or card explaining their resistance (and if so, what it should say), and so forth.\nThis support made it easier for people to continue to resist even when they ran up against the phone company

Who won?\nA victory for evil is just a triumphant form of failure.\nAnd a year and a half after Brown’s execution when Union troops set off to finish the work Brown had started, they were singing “John Brown’s body lies a-mouldering in the grave—his soul is marching on!”\n\nIn the wake of the Harpers Ferry raid with which John Brown hoped to launch a slave rebellion across the United States, Brown was called insane by the pulpit, popular opinion, and the press (even—\u003Cem>especially\u003C/em>—the liberal, abolitionist press).\nSome even said he was insane because of the most \u003Cem>extraordinarily sane\u003C/em> thing about him:\n\n> It is mentioned against him, and as an evidence of his insanity, that he was “a conscientious man, very modest in his demeanor, apparently inoffensive until the subject of slavery was introduced, when he would exhibit a feeling of indignation unparalleled.”\n\nYou would think, with the example of Jesus hovering over Western Civilization, that people would be skeptical of traditional notions of success.\n(Being captured and tortured to death by your enemies and having your followers scorned and scattered throughout a hostile empire doesn’t seem much like a victory.)\nBut Thoreau thought the response to John Brown proved that even after centuries of Christianity, “[i]f Christ should appear on earth he would on all hands be denounced as a mistaken, misguided man, insane & crazed.”\n\nYou don’t have to believe that history will eventually smile on you and turn your seeming defeats and setbacks into obvious victories.\nYou don’t have to believe the nice-sounding but unlikely sentiment that Hennacy liked to quote (he attributed it to Tolstoy): “no sincere effort made in the behalf of Truth is ever lost.”\nYou just need to remember that seemingly small victories in an uncompromising personal revolution can be more worthwhile (when seen from the perspective of what \u003Cem>is\u003C/em> worthwhile, not just what is expedient) than huge triumphs that are born decaying from compromise and half-truths.\n\nSlavery in particular was such an unambiguous evil that to Thoreau it was one of “those cases to which the rule of expediency does not apply.”\nHe made this comparison: if the only way you can save yourself from drowning is to unjustly wrest a plank away from another drowning person, you must instead do what is just even if it kills you.\nIf you are “victorious” in wresting away the plank, and thereby save your own life at the cost of another, you lose.\n\nBut even in cases not as extreme as slavery, he says, compromise and expediency are overrated: “there is no such thing as accomplishing a righteous reform by the use of ‘expediency.’\nThere is no such thing as sliding up hill.\nIn morals the only sliders are backsliders.”\n\nThe personal revolution is more about doing the right thing daily than achieving the right result eventually, so even if it seems that everything is going against you, you can be confident you’re on the right track.\n“[B]e as unconcerned for victory as careless of defeat,” Thoreau advises, “not seeking to lengthen our term of service, nor to cut it short by a reprieve, but earnestly applying ourselves to the campaign before us.”\nOr, as Hennacy put it:\n\n> If you want to change things you have to get 51% of the ballots or the bullets.\n> If I want to change things I just have to keep on doing what I am doing—that is: every day the government says “pay taxes for war”; every day I do not pay taxes for war.\n> So I win and they lose.\n> The One Man Revolution—you can’t beat it.\n\n> Do not let your opponent set the norm.\n> Generally a minority is jeered at because they are so small.\n> It is \u003Cem>quality\u003C/em> and not \u003Cem>quantity\u003C/em> that is the measure.\n> “One on the side of God is a majority” is the perfect answer which I have given dozens of times with success.\n\nIn the worst of times, when someone with moral courage and integrity stands alone and has little hope of accomplishing much by trying to hold back the tide, their seemingly futile assertions of integrity may still be important because of the hope they inspire in others—perhaps unknown people, far away and in the distant future.\nHannah Arendt wrote of her studies of collaborators and resisters during the Holocaust:\n\n> [N]othing can ever be “practically useless,” at least, not in the long run.…\n> For the lesson of such stories is simple and within everyone’s grasp…\n> [U]nder conditions of terror most people will comply but \u003Cem>some people will not\u003C/em>, just as the lesson of the countries to which the Final Solution was proposed is that “it could happen” in most places but \u003Cem>it did not happen everywhere\u003C/em>.\n> Humanly speaking, no more is required, and no more can reasonably be asked, for this planet to remain a place fit for human habitation.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Thoreau quotes from the 21 October 1859 \u003Ci>Boston Journal\u003C/i> in a journal entry begun on 19 October 1859, from \u003Ci>The Price of Freedom\u003C/i> (2008) pp. 204–10\n* Thoreau, H.D., 19 October 1859 journal entry, from \u003Ci>The Price of Freedom\u003C/i> (2008) pp. 204–10\n* Hennacy, Ammon “Radical Philosophy” \u003Ci>The Book of Ammon\u003C/i> (1970) p. 108\n* The closest thing I have found to the “no sincere effort” quote in Tolstoy’s works comes from his 1902 essay “To the Working People” in which he says “…one thing is unquestionable, and that is, that not one sincere effort of a man to act in this matter [the ownership of land] in godly fashion or in accordance with his conscience will be lost.” Tolstoy follows this with a paragraph that harmonizes well with this chapter:\n  > “What can I alone do against all?” people frequently say, when they are confronted with an act which is not countenanced by the majority. To these people it seems that for the success of a thing there must be all, or at least many; but there must be many only for a bad thing. For a good thing it is enough if there be one, because God is always with him who does a good thing. And with whom God is, sooner or later all men will be.\n* Thoreau, H.D.

and should think they ought to find some means by which it would not be necessary for every separate bee to spread her wings and fly off, but by which the whole swarm could fly at once where it wanted to.\n> But that is not possible; till a first, a second, a third, a hundredth bee spreads her wings and flies off of her own accord, the swarm will not fly off and will not begin its new life.\n> Till every individual man makes the Christian conception of life his own, and begins to live in accord with it, there can be no solution of the problem of human life, and no establishment of a new form of life.\n\nSometimes, a single personal revolutionary really does change the world.\nMaybe the world was already ripe for changing, but it still needed a personal revolutionary to break from the pack and make the change happen.\n\nWhat became known as the Coventry “tithe war” began modestly, with one solitary revolutionary taking flight and inviting the rest of the hive to join him.\nA contemporary newspaper account, in explaining where this sudden uprising came from, traced its roots to this one person who was willing to be thought eccentric even by his allies, while waiting for them to realize he was taking the lead:\n\n> A few individual citizens have maintained a consistent protest against a tax which they declared offended their consciences, and one tradesman, whose goods have been distrained year after year, has retaliated with equal regularity by issuing handbills setting forth his woes, and the rapacity of what he was wont to describe as “Mother Church.”\n> The leading Nonconformists, and it may be said the Nonconformists as a body, have until lately refrained from all open sympathy with this suffering brother, whose controversial tactics were generally regarded as somewhat wanting in good taste.\n> In the Autumn of last year the annual testimony borne in this quarter attracted more attention than usual in consequence of an open-air indignation meeting by which it was followed.\n> The meeting was by no means influentially attended, and it was not believed at the time that it would have any important consequences.\n> It led, however, to the formation of an Anti-Vicars’ Rate Association, whose action has brought about the present crisis.\n\nHennacy says self-transforming doers like Christ, the Buddha, Gandhi, or Joan of Arc were far more radical than theorizers like Marx or Bakunin.\nThoreau would agree (though his own list—“Minerva, Ceres, Neptune, Prometheus, Socrates, Christ, Luther, Columbus, Arkwright”—was a little more ethereal).\n“I know of few radicals as yet who are radical enough,” he said, “and have not got this name rather by meddling with the exposed roots of innocent institutions than with their own.”\n\nHumankind doesn’t progress by passively absorbing the inevitable bounty of history grinding away unconsciously on the masses, as the Hegelians might have it.\nRather, says Thoreau, “The great benefactors of their race have been single and singular and not masses of men.\nWhether in poetry or history it is the same.”\nWe should not be content to admire these heroes, or to await their arrival, but should be inspired by their examples to each be as heroic as we can.\n\n> The gods have given man no constant gift, but the power and liberty to act greatly.\n> How many wait for health and warm weather to be heroic and noble!\n> We are apt to think there is a kind of virtue which need not be heroic and brave—but in fact virtue is the deed of the bravest; and only the hardy souls venture upon it, for it deals in what we have no experience, and alone does the rude pioneer work of the world.\n\n> Action from principle,—the perception and the performance of right,—changes things and relations; it is essentially revolutionary, and does not consist wholly with any thing which was.\n> It not only divides states and churches, it divides families; aye, it divides the individual, separating the diabolical in him from the divine.\n\n> There is something proudly thrilling in the thought that this obedience to conscience and trust in God, which is so solemnly preached in extremities and arduous circumstances, is only to retreat to one’s self, and rely on our own strength.\n> In trivial circumstances I find myself sufficient to myself, and in the most momentous I have no ally but myself, and must silently put by their harm by my own strength, as I did the former.\n> As my own hand bent aside the willow in my path, so must my single arm put to flight the devil and his angels.\n> God is not our ally when we shrink, and neuter when we are bold.\n> If by trusting in God you lose any particle of your vigor, trust in Him no longer.…\n> I cannot afford to relax discipline because God is on my side, for He is on the side of discipline.\n\nWe can’t all be Christ, Buddha, Gandhi, or Joan of Arc.\n(Steve Allen said that Ammon Hennacy was more of a Lenny Bruce-style character; Hennacy’s wife suggested that Don Quixote might be a better match.)\nIt is only one-in-a-million who moves the world, but despite the odds we all should aspire to be this one in a million.\nHennacy put it this way:\n\n> Love without courage and wisdom is sentimentality, as with the ordinary church member.\n> Courage without love and wisdom is foolhardiness, as with the ordinary soldier.\n> Wisdom without love and courage is cowardice, as with the ordinary intellectual.\n> Therefore one who has love, courage, and wisdom is one in a million who moves the world, as with Jesus, Buddha, and Gandhi.\n\nIf we choose this goal, even if we fall short, we not only have chosen a truly worthy goal, but we adjust our standards so that if we are ever lucky enough to meet this one in a million, we will be more likely to recognize her or him.\nToo many people are incapable of recognizing or comprehending the hero in real life—we lionize the dead martyred heroes of past generations, but join the lynch mobs to martyr the heroes of our own.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Tolstoy, Leo “The Kingdom of God Is Within You” (Constance Garnett translation, 1894), pp. 214–15\n* “Coventry’s Church War” \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> 29 September 1882 (reprinted from the \u003Ci>London Times\u003C/i>)\n* Hennacy, Ammon “A Final Word from the Author” \u003Ci>The Book of Ammon\u003C/i> (1970) front matter\n* Thoreau.

are also disadvantages:\nIt takes time and negotiation and coordination to get a bunch of people to act together, and usually this means you need to find some common denominator of principle or risk that everyone can agree on.\nThis can water down the core of what you’re fighting for until it seems less like a principle than a petty grievance—and once you’ve done that, it may not seem worth fighting for.\n\nIn this way a movement risks gaining size at the expense of losing passion.\nAny force it gains from greater numbers it may lose from the diffuse, blunted, half-hearted effort of the individuals that make it up, or from the fact that much of their energy is expended on the organizing itself rather than on the ostensible goals of the organization.\n\nThe advantage of drawing a large crowd of half-hearted followers may not be worth the effort.\nIt is not too hard to sway a crowd of wishy-washy people by appealing to the half-truths they already believe and being careful not to attack any of the nonsense they adhere to.\nBut what does this get you?\nA crowd of wishy-washy people who are just as vulnerable to falling for the next demagogue who comes along with patronizing speeches.\nInstead, Hennacy recommends, we should “appeal to those about ready to make the next step and… know that these are very few indeed.”\n\nWhen Thoreau was invited to give a speech, he refused to water down his message to make it palatable to all his listeners.\nHe wasn’t aiming for the sympathy of the crowd, but he hoped to reach those one or two people who were ready to be challenged.\nHe was amused at the response to one of his talks:\nThe “craven priest” who had invited him to speak was “looking for a hole to escape at” and there was “an awful silence” in the audience.\n“But,” he reflected, “the seed has not all fallen in stony & shallow ground.”\n\nThoreau noted with approval that the abolitionist revolutionary John Brown had \u003Cem>not\u003C/em> gathered around him a large party of well-wishers and collaborators, but instead had been very selective about whom he let in on his plans:\n\n> I hear many condemn these men because they were so few.\n> When were the good and the brave ever in a majority?\n> Would you have had him wait till that time came?—till you and I came over to him?…\n\n> The very fact that [Brown] had no rabble or troop of hirelings about him would alone distinguish him from ordinary heroes.\n> His company was small indeed, because few could be found worthy to pass muster.\n> He would have no rowdy or swaggerer, no profane swearer, for, as he said, he always found these men to fail at last.\n> He would have only men of principle, and they are few.\n\nHe quotes Brown as saying:\n\n> I would rather have the small-pox, yellow-fever, and cholera, all together in my camp, than a man without principle.…\n> Give me men of good principles,—God-fearing men,—men who respect themselves, and with a dozen of them I will oppose any hundred such

place.\nThat is the counterrevolution Hennacy was describing when he answered a reporter’s question—“Hennacy, do you think you can change the world?”—with “No, but I am damn sure it can’t change

the exemplar and sow the seeds?\n\n1. Accept responsibility and act responsibly.\n1. Build yourself a glass house and start throwing stones.\n\n## Accept Responsibility and Act Responsibly\n\nMost political action amounts to “who can we find to take responsibility for this problem”.\nThe personal revolutionary asks “what is \u003Cem>my\u003C/em> responsibility?”\n\nNot that everything is your responsibility, or that the world is looking to you to solve all of its problems.\nBut you should at the very least examine your life to see which problems or solutions you are contributing to.\nCan one person make a difference?\nYou are \u003Cem>already\u003C/em> making a difference—the real question is: what kind of difference are you making?\nAs Thoreau put it:\n\n> It is not a man’s duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the eradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still properly have other concerns to engage him, but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to give it practically his support.\n> If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man’s shoulders.\n> I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too.…\n\n> A man has not every thing to do, but something; and because he cannot do \u003Cem>every thing\u003C/em>, it is not necessary that he should do \u003Cem>something\u003C/em> wrong.\n\nIn Thoreau’s time, the evils of slavery and of wars of conquest were sustained by the active allegiance and support of ordinary people around him, many of whom nonetheless congratulated themselves for their anti-war, anti-slavery opinions.\nSo he did not address his protest to the government, but to his neighbors:\n\n> I quarrel not with far-off foes, but with those who, near at home, cooperate with, and do the bidding of those far away, and without whom the latter would be harmless.…\n>\n> I have heard some of my townsmen say, “I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico,—see if I would go;” and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute.\n> The soldier is applauded who refuses to serve in an unjust war by those who do not refuse to sustain the unjust government which makes the war.…\n>\n> Those who, while they disapprove of the character and measures of a government, yield to it their allegiance and support, are undoubtedly its most conscientious supporters, and so frequently the most serious obstacles to reform.\n> Some are petitioning the State to dissolve the Union, to disregard the requisitions of the President.\n> Why do they not dissolve it themselves,—the union between themselves and the State,—and refuse to pay their quota into its treasury?…\n>\n> If a thousand men were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood.\n> This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible.\n\nDon’t be fooled into thinking that because the personal revolution is in your heart that it can just stay there, locked up inside, without leaking out into the world around you:\n\n> As to conforming outwardly, and living your own life inwardly, I have not a very high opinion of that course.\n> Do not let your right hand know what your left hand does in that line of business.\n> I have no doubt it will prove a failure.\n\nThe personal revolution doesn’t \u003Cem>necessarily\u003C/em> require living in opposition to society and the status quo, but it does require holding fast to justice and virtue.\nWhen society and the status quo try to put you in opposition to justice and virtue, as they so often do, this puts them in opposition to you as well, and you to them.\n\n## Build Yourself a Glass House and Start Throwing Stones\n\nYour friends and even your enemies will come to your aid when you hold yourself to a high standard.\nAll you have to do is to make yourself vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy.\nPeople love to point out hypocritical moralists, in part because some hypocritical moralists are hilarious, but also in part because it helps people excuse their own failure to hold themselves to a high standard.\nIf you build yourself a glass house and throw stones from it, everyone will volunteer to keep you on the straight-and-narrow.\n\nHennacy:\n\n> I have… put myself in a glass house.\n> If so I must needs take whatever stones come my way.\n> I have the right by my life of integrity to criticize, but I must also take whatever criticism comes my way in all good humor.…\n>\n> [A] spoiled and arrogant priest wanted to know if I was “holier than thou.”\n> I told him I hoped by Christ I was, for if I wasn’t I would be in a hell of a fix.\n> I used this blunt method to deflate his spurious piety.\n\n> At times those who do not want to have their inconsistencies pointed out say in a super-sweet voice to me “judge not, lest ye be judged.”\n> I reply, “O.K., judge me, then.”\n\nWhen your standards for yourself rise, so do your standards for other people (otherwise you really \u003Cem>are\u003C/em> being arrogant).\nThoreau, criticized for demanding too much from people, said he could not “convince myself that I have any right to be satisfied with men as they are, and to treat them accordingly, and not according, in some respects, to my requisitions and expectations of what they and I ought to be.”\n\nWhile both Thoreau and Hennacy strike me as having been stern with others, and maybe not always fun to be around (as Hennacy said: “I love my enemies but am hell on my friends”), they were anything but joyless.\nThoreau’s vigorous, enthusiastic love of life is legendary, and Hennacy’s character too was eager, life-affirming, and generous (even in its criticisms).\n\nUtah Phillips came home from the Korean war a drunken brawler.\nHe checked in to Hennacy’s Catholic Worker hospitality house in Salt Lake City, and eight years later checked out again—sober, a pacifist, and an anarchist.\nHe remembered Hennacy this way:\n\n> He was tough without being hard—tough without that brittle hardness that some tough men have that would shatter if you struck it too hard.\n> “Love in Action,” Dorothy Day called him—Dostoyevsky’s words: “Love in action is harsh and dreadful compared to love in dreams.”\n\nNeither Thoreau nor Hennacy had any tolerance for bliss-bunnyishness, but both were cheerful; both knew how to be dutiful without being dour.\nThoreau:\n\n> To march sturdily through life, patiently and resolutely looking grim defiance at one’s foes, that is one way; but we cannot help being more attracted by that kind of heroism which relaxes its brows in the presence of danger, and does not need to maintain itself strictly, but, by a kind of sympathy with the universe, generously adorns the scene and the occasion, and loves valor so well that itself would be the defeated party only to behold it; which is as serene and as well pleased with the issue as the heavens which look down upon the field of battle.\n> It is but a lower height of heroism when the hero wears a sour face.…\n>\n> A great cheerfulness indeed have all great wits and heroes possessed, almost a profane levity to such as understood them not, but their religion had the broader basis of health and permanence.\n> For the hero, too, has his religion, though it is the very opposite to that of the ascetic.\n> It demands not a narrower cell but a wider world.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and

Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially falseness to yourself. Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every hour, every minute. Avoid being scornful, both to others and to yourself. What seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of your observing it in yourself. Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the consequence of every sort of falsehood. Never be frightened at your own faint-heartedness in attaining love. Don’t be frightened overmuch even at your evil actions. I am sorry I can say nothing more consoling to you, for love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams. Love in dreams is greedy for immediate action, rapidly performed and in the sight of all. Men will even give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon over, with all looking on and applauding as though on the stage. But active love is labour and fortitude, and for some people too, perhaps, a complete science.\n* Thoreau, H.D.

resist paying taxes from a variety of motives and with a variety of goals in mind.",[],{"order":230,"hidden":39,"attrs":1437},{},"People resist paying taxes from a variety of motives and with a variety of goals in mind.\nThis book examines many tactics that augment tax resistance campaigns, but some of these tactics are only appropriate for some varieties of tax resister and will only help to meet the goals of some types of resistance campaign.\n\nWhat sort of tax resister are you?\nWhat are the goals your campaign hopes to accomplish?\nYou need to consider those questions before you can choose tactics that are appropriate for your campaign.\n\nIn this chapter you will learn about four common varieties of tax resister and their goals.\nYou’ll also learn what to do if your campaign contains resisters from more than one category who, as a result, may find it difficult to agree on tactics.\nAs an example of such a conundrum, I’ll discuss the difficult case of the current American war tax resistance movement, which is challenged by containing resisters from all four categories:\n\n1. the conscientious objector\n1. the protester\n1. the nonviolent resister\n1. the legal challenger\n\n## The Conscientious Objector\n\nTax resisters who are motivated by conscientious objection are profoundly opposed to the unethical activities of the government.\nThey feel that to pay taxes would make them \u003Cem>participants\u003C/em> in those activities.\nThey consider the risks of tax resistance to be worth taking because they believe the risks of behaving unethically are worse.\n\nThe classic example of this is a pacifist who is unwilling either to take up a weapon to kill in war, or to pay for somebody else to do so by paying a war tax.\n\nThe goal of conscientious objectors is to wash their hands of complicity.\nSuch resisters don’t necessarily care if the government knows about their resistance, and don’t necessarily feel like they need to be part of a movement.\nResisting taxes is itself the right thing to do, they feel, and they would resist even if they were alone in doing so and even if nobody else were aware that they were resisting.\n\nHenry David Thoreau explained his tax resistance in the language of a conscientious objector:\n\n> It is not a man’s duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the eradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still properly have other concerns to engage him; but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to give it practically his support.…\n> I have heard some of my townsmen say, “I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico,—see if I would go;” and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute.\n\n## The Protester\n\nPeople who resist taxes as a form of protest, on the other hand, very much want others to know about what they are doing.\nThey want to amplify their complaint by publicly breaking the law and inviting the legal consequences.\nThis communicates the strength of their objections and their willingness to sacrifice and take risks for these beliefs.\n\nIf the government responds to their tax resistance by seizing money from them, that doesn’t necessarily represent a defeat to protesters.\nTheir tax resistance is more about taking a principled oppositional stand than about the actual money involved.\n\nFor example, tax resisters in the women’s suffrage movement in the U.K. wanted to demonstrate the self-serving hypocrisy of a male-exclusive government that treated women as people when it came time to tax them, but as non-people when it came time to ask for the consent of the governed.\nThese resisters openly defied the government and dared it to arrest them or seize their property.\nThen they used such reprisals as opportunities for further protest.\nThey were civil-disobedient protesters, and their tactics reflect this.\n\n## The Nonviolent Resister\n\n“Withholding payment of taxes is one of the quickest methods of overthrowing a government,” said Gandhi.\nResisters who hope to reduce the resources available to the government and thereby force it to change its behavior (or perhaps even to weaken and then overthrow it), are using tax resistance as a form of nonviolent conflict.\nSuch resisters need lots of comrades to join in the struggle, and they prefer those tactics that cost the government the most.\n\nFor example, tax resisters in the movement that pressed for the Reform Act of 1832 in the U.K. wanted to “stop the supplies”—that is, to withhold enough money from the government that it would be crippled and would be forced to grant the movement’s demands.\nSo they augmented their tax strike with a run on the Bank of England.\nThey used tax resistance as part of a campaign of nonviolent conflict meant to force political change.\n\n## The Legal Challenger\n\nSome tax resisters resist because they conclude that the tax they are resisting was enacted illegally, is being imposed by an institution without the proper authority to do so, or is being illegally applied to them in particular.\nThey resist in anticipation of such a legal theory being found to be correct, and for the tax to be legally abolished.\n\nFor example, property tax resisters in Depression-era Chicago refused to pay while they pursued a legal challenge to property assessments that had left many wealthy and well-connected property owners exempt.\nThey eventually won their case, which found the assessments—and therefore the taxes based on them—to be invalid.\n\n## Resisters from Multiple Categories\n\nSome resisters belong to more than one category.\nFor instance, a tax resister may be initially motivated by conscientious objection, but may also hope to also make their tax resistance a public protest.\nOr a resistance campaign may believe a tax to be illegal and it may advise people to resist on that account, while also believing that if enough people resist, this will help to force the government to acknowledge their legal interpretation.\n\nThere is some natural overlap between the varieties of resister I have mentioned.\nIt’s possible for your campaign to include resisters with motives and goals from multiple varieties, without this being confusing or causing problems.\n\n## Resisters with Uncoordinated Motives and Tactics\n\nBut I’ve also noticed some tax resisters get confused.\nThey believe they can “mix and match” tactics and rhetoric from various categories without giving much attention to whether their mix makes for a coherent recipe.\n\nFor example, some war tax resisters use the rhetoric of conscientious objection when they explain the motives for their resistance, but then choose \u003Cem>symbolic\u003C/em> tactics (like resisting only a certain percentage of their tax) that are more appropriate to someone who resists as a form of protest and that wouldn’t meet the goals of a true conscientious objector.\n\nBecause confused tax resisters like these have disconnects between their motives, tactics, and goals, they are less effective in meeting their goals and also less convincing when they try to get support or sympathy for their stand.\n\n\u003Chr
