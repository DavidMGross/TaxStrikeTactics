Secrets to Success","Your tax resistance campaign can change the course of history if it learns from the lessons history has to teach.",[],{"order":96,"hidden":39,"attrs":97},1,{},"Your tax resistance campaign can make history if it learns from the lessons history has to teach.\nThis book introduces you to tax resistance campaigns from around the world and over thousands of years—including many campaigns that were successful in meeting their goals.\nReading examples of the tactics they used will help you brainstorm new ways to lead your campaign to victory.\n\nIf you learn how history’s tax resistance campaigns have played out, you have a great advantage: you don’t have to reinvent the wheel and you aren’t forced to stick with worn out tactics just because they’re familiar.\n\nA tax resistance campaign will be more successful if it takes advantage of the rich resource history provides.\nSadly, though, some tax resisters I meet today have little interest in the lessons of the past—they seem to feel as though all they have to do is to take a noble, confrontational stand and then the government must inevitably give in.\n\nWhy might this be?\nIt might be because of the way the popular media represents successful activist movements of the past—like the civil rights movement in the United States.\nThe most photogenic parts of such movements, and therefore those parts that are most often seen in documentary footage, were big rallies and marches like the March on Washington, public civil disobedience actions like the lunch counter sit-ins, and confrontations with baton-wielding cops.\nToday’s activists sometimes act as though they think that if those photogenic elements can be resummoned somehow, success can’t be far behind—in much the same way that “cargo cult” practitioners hope to resummon the bountiful airplanes to their island by building an ersatz air control tower out of bamboo.\n\nYou might as well expect to gain independence for California by throwing crates of tea into San Francisco Bay.\nSuperficial fetishization of the theatrical residue of history gets you a renaissance faire, not a successful activist movement.\n\nThe successful tax resistance campaigns I have studied engaged in struggles on many fronts, using a variety of tactics, and with a great deal of hard work and organizing behind the scenes—the dramatic sit-ins and

successful if it takes advantage of the rich resource history provides.\nSadly, though, some tax resisters I meet today have little interest in the lessons of the past—they seem to feel as though all

represents successful activist movements of the past—like the civil rights movement in the United States.\nThe most photogenic parts of such movements, and therefore those parts that are most often seen in documentary footage, were big rallies and marches like the March on Washington, public civil disobedience actions like the lunch counter sit-ins, and confrontations with baton-wielding cops.\nToday’s activists sometimes act as though they think that if those photogenic elements can be resummoned somehow, success can’t be far behind—in much the same way that “cargo cult”

supporters of marriage equality expressed their outrage against this decision by getting arrested for blocking a city street in San Francisco.\n\nThis is a peculiar and nowadays popular form of protest.\nIt bears some resemblance to civil disobedience, but is really its own, distinct phenomenon.\nIn civil disobedience, one of the following two conditions hold:\n\n1. Either the law that you are breaking is itself immoral in some way, and that is the reason you are breaking it,\n1. or, although the law itself might be unobjectionable to you, you are acting to prevent a wrong (or promote a good) in a way that requires you to incidentally break that law.\n\nSo, for instance, people violating the Fugitive Slave Act by operating a station on the Underground Railroad were breaking a law that they believed was itself an immoral law.\nOn the other hand, people who are arrested at blockades usually are not opposed to laws against trespassing or blocking traffic or whatever they end up being charged with—rather, they are violating those laws incidentally while trying to prevent some greater harm.\n\nBut in the case of the people who were arrested blocking the street in San Francisco—and much the same is true of most other so-called “civil disobedience” actions I’ve seen in recent years—they were neither asserting that laws against blocking traffic were immoral, nor did they believe that blocking traffic would prevent some greater harm that would be caused by allowing that traffic to proceed as normal.\n\nInstead, \u003Cem>getting arrested\u003C/em>—whatever the charge and whatever the action leading to it—was itself the point, and seemed to be mostly a way of publicizing and amplifying one’s sense of outrage, anguish, or commitment.\nLess like a civil disobedience action, it was more like the action of a mourner who wails and covers himself in ashes, or a penitent who whips himself with a lash.\nBeing arrested has become a sort of government-sponsored method of certifying the strength of one’s opinion.\n\nHere are some excerpts from a newspaper article on the arrests:\n\n> Earlier in the day, police arrested more than 100 protesters blocking Van Ness Avenue near the Civic Center after giving the chanting, sign-waving crowd more than an hour to vent its anger and sadness.

into what I call the “petulant mode” of protest.\n\nPetulance paints the relationship between the protester and the target of the protest as like that of an unruly child to a parent.\nPetulant tactics can take the form of making “demands” with nothing much to back them up but the demand itself.\nOr they can take the form of protest methods that seem taken from the playbook of a two-year-old—grown-up versions of “I’ll hold my breath until I die if you don’t give me what I want” or “I’m going to stomp my feet and scream if I don’t get my way.”\n\nBecause they take the form of a tantrum, petulant protests increase bystander sympathy for the parentish figure and reduce sympathy for the childish figure.\nSuch protests also reinforce the idea that the parentish figure ought naturally to be making the decisions.\nIn other words, petulant tactics \u003Cem>bolster\u003C/em> the authority of the target of the protest.\n\nWise parents do not give in to temper tantrums, and similarly, targets of petulant protests appear wise and sympathetic when they do not give in or when they defuse such a protest by conciliating in token and condescending ways.\nThis makes it less likely that the goals of the protesters will be met (if those goals depend on changing the behavior of the protest target).\n\nA petulant protest is not an act of assertiveness, but a symptom of submissiveness.\nPetulant tactics can reinforce protesters’ feelings of inferiority and powerlessness, and thereby discourage them from taking the necessary bold, confident, and effective steps to create change.\nInferior and powerless people whine, make toothless demands, and throw tantrums.\nEqual and confident people look each other in the eye, state their cases calmly and forthrightly, and do what they feel they have to do without making a big hullabaloo.\nPetulant protesters, by reinforcing the feelings of social superiority in their targets, can make those targets less inclined to negotiate or to listen.\n\nDefenders of petulant protest tactics might argue that such tactics are best because their targets are not like wise parents at all, but like foolish ones, and in such cases the squeaky wheel gets the grease.\nAlso, some protesters may be forced into positions of powerless inferiority and then have no recourse but to use petulant tactics that are appropriate to such a position—for instance, the Irish prisoners who used tactics like hunger strikes or smearing the walls of their cells with feces.\nThere is little dignity in shit-smearing, but a prisoner has fewer options for dignified resistance and so may reasonably decide to choose from other tactics.\n\nBut even if there are situations in which petulant tactics are called for, these days I often see such tactics used at times and in ways that seem to me to be counterproductive.\nSwitching to tactics that are dignified and that assert the social and ethical equality of the protesters and the protest target might be more effective—both at winning the immediate goals of the protesters and (what ought to be among the long-term goals of anyone working for a better world) at encouraging more healthy relationships among people and between people and institutions.\n\nFor example, the lunch counter sit-ins during the American civil rights movement were done in a dignified way: polite, well-disciplined black Americans sat at “whites-only” lunch counters, and stayed there in patient expectation of being treated in a reciprocally dignified manner although they were refused service.\nIf they had chosen a petulant mode of protest, they might have then begun chanting (“whose counter? \u003Cem>our\u003C/em> counter!”), or abusing the staff, or maybe vandalizing the lunch counters.\nInstead, they stuck with the quiet dignity approach, and let the white racists monopolize the petulant tactics (violence, verbal abuse, spitting on or pouring catsup over the protesters, and other things of that nature).\nThe dignified mode arguably was a more effective tactic for ending lunch counter segregation (the immediate goal of the protests), but was certainly a more effective strategy for discrediting racism and Jim Crow and for increasing sympathy with the civil rights movement.\n\nThis example is more cut-and-dried than most, since the battle against Jim Crow was so centered on asserting dignity and equality—but I think most other individual and grassroots political actions would also benefit from transcending the petulant and taking a forthright, dignified, confident posture.\n\nHow do we defend ourselves against this temptation to use the petulant mode at times when it is unnecessary and counter-productive?\n\nFirst, acknowledge that the temptation exists, and that it springs from the protesters’ feelings of inferiority with respect to the protest target.\nProtesters go into petulant mode for much the same reason a child does—because we despair of being listened to or heeded any other way and we are too powerless, inarticulate, or uncreative to use more effective methods of meeting our goals.\n\nSecond, make an effort to examine protest tactics that you come across or that are proposed to you with an eye to discerning to what extent they use the petulant mode.\nShare your observations with others; compare notes.\nEvaluate protests not only in terms of how they might meet immediate goals but in what impressions they create or reinforce about the relationship between the protesters, the protest targets, and bystanders.\n\nThird, reimagine your relationship with the targets of your protests in such a way as to suspend or dispel any feeling of inferiority.\nIf you felt yourself to be the social and ethical equal of the people who are the target of your protest (as you perhaps already consider yourself to be, on a rational level), how would you convey your protest to them and how would you expect them to respond?\n\nFourth, know that petulance is usually meant to intensify or amplify a protest that feels too small, unnoticed, or insufficient.\nWhen you feel the petulant temptation, see if maybe you can amplify your protest in some other fashion.\nIf not, consider that maybe a quiet, dignified, under-the-radar protest might nonetheless be more effective in the long run than a loud, annoying, attention-getting, petulant one.\n\nFifth, be honest with yourself and others about what you are doing and what goals you can reasonably expect to accomplish.\nPetulant protest is often accompanied by bluster and exaggeration, which can damage your credibility and also can lead to discouragement when reality sets in.\n\nBy taking care in this way, you can increase the effectiveness of your actions, reduce the risk of burnout, become more appealing and convincing to potential sympathizers, and contribute to a better world in the long run.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and

Violence and Nonviolence","Some tax resistance campaigns are nonviolent, some are not.",[],{"order":54,"hidden":39,"attrs":178},{},"Tax resistance is one of the techniques studied by scholars of nonviolent conflict.\nThis is a field of study that has attracted a lot of attention in recent years, particularly because of the success of mass “people power” uprisings that used varieties of nonviolent resistance tactics and that explicitly disavowed violence.\n\nBut of the tax resistance campaigns I studied, only some made an effort to maintain nonviolence.\nMany others were willing and able to augment their tax resistance with violent tactics.\nOthers were incidentally nonviolent without having made any special commitment to be so.\nThis book covers both violent and nonviolent tactics (as well as some tactics, like property destruction or sabotage, that some people consider to be violent and others do not).\n\nViolence certainly can be an effective way to disrupt the tax collecting bureaucracy.\nMost tax collectors are not particularly enthusiastic about their calling to begin with, and so a little violent intimidation can go a long way in discouraging them.\nThis in turn makes tax collection more expensive for the government, decreasing its return-on-investment and compelling the government either to tighten its belt or to resort to higher taxes and thereby encourage more people to resist.\n\nBut violence also has a way of backfiring.\nSome of the tax resistance campaigns I studied showed great success right up to the point where they started relying on violent tactics, whereupon they lost popular support, became subject to easier-to-justify draconian crack-downs, or reinvigorated their opponents.\nViolence also harms the body politic (and so also those resisters who make up part of it) by increasing fear, divisiveness, and tension, by giving precedent to people who use violence to try to resolve their conflicts, by making it harder for opposing sides to come to a reconciliation, and so forth.\nAnd of course, in many cases, it is just cruel and wrong in its own right.\n\nFor the most part, I present examples of violent tactics without passing judgement on whether or not I think they were justified.\nSome examples of tax resistance campaigns, for example the Rebecca Riots in Wales, are hard to imagine without violence.\nOthers, like the Regulator movement in colonial North Carolina, seem to me to be cases where violent tactics were counterproductive to the point of being disastrous.\nAnd sometimes the violence was so cruel or misdirected that even if you were being generous about the ends justifying the means you would be hard-pressed to defend it.\n\nBut it’s also worth remembering that some injustice—particularly government-sanctioned injustice—masquerades as nonviolence while really having a violent nature.\nSo long as the veiled threat of violence is enough to subdue challenges, what looks like “peace” prevails and superficially nonviolent behavior contains hidden violence.\n\n## Authority\n\nPolitical authority is the pinnacle of government achievement, and almost all governments strive to be seen by their subjects as having such authority—as ruling “legitimately.”\nSuch authority evolves from an origin of mixed coercion and persuasion.\nA political system of 100% persuasion—the anarchist ideal—is what takes place in non-governed settings: for example, a group of friends deciding what sort of pizza to order will typically use persuasion, even if this results in setting up a democratic or monarchical decision-making process by temporary consensus.\n\nBut at the large-scale political level, even a 100% persuasive origin can perhaps evolve (or devolve) into an authority-based state.\nThis is the mythical origin of Hobbes’s Leviathan, of Robert Nozick’s minimal state, and various other creatures of political philosophy in-between.\n\nOutside of philosophy, things are typically more mixed:\nFor example, the Federalist Papers were a measure of persuasion that prepared Americans to be ruled by their emerging federal government, and the military repression of various unpersuaded Americans (for instance in the Whiskey Rebellion) was a measure of coercion.\nMixed together with many other ingredients, of such a recipe was the American republic made, and it is the relatively high proportion of persuasion in that mix that gives its founding such a good reputation in some quarters.\n\nOne way of looking at political authority is as a mixture of coercion and persuasion that is held in reserve:\nan energy that is potential, rather than kinetic—like a battery.\nAnother physical metaphor is to consider authority as the momentum built up through the application of coercion and persuasion, such that the momentum itself has the same sort of power that the original coercion and persuasion did.\n\nThe momentum of authority allows the government to coast:\n“We could persuade you, but you are already persuaded, remember?\nWe could compel you, but you are already compelled, remember?”\nMeanwhile its subjects feel persuaded without knowing quite which arguments persuaded them, and feel compelled without ever feeling the grip on their shoulders or the bayonet at their backs.\n\nIf a government’s authority is challenged, it will temporarily retrench into a position from which it can unleash its potential political energy as kinetic political energy and thereby remove the challenge.\nIt will use the tools of coercion and persuasion that it has kept in reserve.\n\nIn this way, nonviolent resistance can make visible the hidden violence of authoritarian coercion.\nBy challenging the authority of the government, you call its bluff and force it to reveal its hand.\nIf it has a strong persuasive hand, well, there you go, and maybe you’re even persuaded.\nIf it has a strong coercive hand, suddenly people begin to feel its tight grip on their shoulders.\nIf neither hand is strong, suddenly this too is exposed, and the power-behind-the-throne is revealed to be not so powerful after all.\n\nFor this reason it may be important and useful for you to force the government to retrench from authority to its more concrete basis in coercion and persuasion, even if you do not have the power to overcome it once it has retrenched.\n\nThe danger is that if you challenge the government to drop its mask of authority and show you the fangs of coercion that lie behind it, you might very well get bit.\nAnd the stronger and more effective your challenge to authority is, the more vicious will be the government’s reaction.\n\nThe more benign the government you challenge, the more it will try to retreat into a stance dominated by persuasion over coercion.\nThe more malign it is, the more eagerly it will bring out the hardware.\nBut the paradox is that the longer you wait and the more malevolent the government becomes, the more dangerous it becomes to challenge it, while at the same time such a challenge becomes more imperative.\n\nThe way out of this dilemma is to be quicker to challenge political authority (and this means saying “no” to its commands, not merely grumbling “I disapprove” to its heralds)—and to make this challenge at the first sign that authority is misused, rather than waiting until it has become so tyrannical that it knows no limits.\n\n## Ineffectiveness Is Not a Nonviolent Tactic\n\nSome people think nonviolent action is perversely self-sabotaging—like fighting with one hand tied behind your back.\nIf you were really serious about winning, they believe, you wouldn’t be so foolish as to surrender some of the tools in your toolkit before the struggle even begins.\n\nI think this argument has arisen less because nonviolent action is inherently flawed, and more because many activists and activist groups have used “nonviolence” as their excuse for choosing ineffective tactics that don’t involve much risk (particularly the risk of success).\nThe American anti-war movement, for instance, is plagued by groups that insist on repeating the same set of toothless tactics that have consistently failed to make any headway, almost as though failure has become such an ingrained tradition that it’s taboo to question it.\n\nIn reaction to this are the violent, “black bloc”-style protesters and the anti-nonviolence theoreticians like Derrick Jensen or Ward Churchill.\nThey see nonviolent protest as a pathetic and timid pleading to an unresponsive and hostile government—symbolic rather than direct, predictable (and predictably ineffective), self-aggrandizing, hobbyish, and effectively collaborationist with political authority and therefore violent by proxy—ultimately, no better than the electoral process at generating real change.\nAnd they’re not willing to go along with the well-worn techniques of losing.\n\nFor a movement dedicated to nonviolence to withstand such challenges, it must not mistake a non-confrontational action for a non-violent one, or confuse making an “incredibly powerful statement” with making progress.\n\nPeople who are committed to nonviolence and who want to discourage violence in their campaigns should ask how Gandhi prevented the Indian National Congress from choosing the tactics of those in India who were advocating armed insurrection.\nThe answer: he was more hard-core than they were, and he demonstrated results.\n\n## Satyagraha\n\nDeliberate, principled, Gandhi-style nonviolence not only can be an effective technique of political force, but it includes safeguards that make it difficult to use in the service of injustice. A Gandhian revolution seems better-protected from devolving, as so many other revolutions have, into one in which the revolutionaries become the oppressors.\n\n![](../../../assets/gandhi-nehru.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru confer at the 1937 Indian National Congress\u003C/figcaption>\n\nGandhi initially used the English term “passive resistance” to describe his techniques.\nBut the phrase led to confusion.\nGandhi was once introduced to an English-speaking audience by a friend who inadvertently insulted Gandhi’s work in South Africa—saying that Gandhi’s forces “are weak and have no arms.\nTherefore they have taken to passive resistance which is the weapon of the weak.”\n\nGandhi decided that “passive resistance” was an inappropriate description:\n“it was supposed to be a weapon of the weak… could be characterized by hatred, and… could finally manifest itself as violence.”\nHe decided to use the term satyagraha (roughly-translated: “truth-force”) instead, and he took pains to emphasize that it was a powerful tool for the strong, not a second-best tactic of the weak.\n\nSatyagraha includes a more radical limitation than the renunciation of violence—in its purest forms it also includes the renunciation of \u003Cem>force\u003C/em>—except perhaps persuasive moral force—and it sets much loftier political goals than run-of-the-mill nonviolent action.\nIt does not claim victory in the defeat or subjugation of its foes—instead, victory comes when those foes, under no threat aside from that of their own awakened consciences, willingly and gladly change their behavior and rejoin the satyagrahi in a cooperative community.\n\nThis restricts your choice of tactics much more than a commitment to “nonviolence” does.\nWould Gandhi have signed off on the lunch counter sit-ins of the American civil rights movement?\nIt is possible that he would have considered them to be too coercive.\nBlockades and sit-ins designed to prevent people from doing business or moving about could be considered violations of satyagraha—only sit-ins like those caused when the authorities prevent people from legitimately continuing on their way are thoroughly non-forceful.\nAll lawbreaking under satyagraha is supposed to be done openly, and with the expectation and even invitation of state sanctions—would being a necessarily secret station on the Underground Railroad have been an acceptable technique for a satyagrahi, I wonder?\n\nIn Gandhi’s eye, the means so necessarily and thoroughly shaped the nature of the ends that these scrupulous distinctions were important:\n“Let us first take the argument that we [in India] are justified in gaining our end by using brute force because the English gained theirs by similar means…\n[B]y using similar means we can get only the same thing that they got.\nYou will admit that we do not want that.”\nHe used this analogy:\n\n> If I want to deprive you of your watch, I shall certainly have to fight for it; if I want to buy your watch, I shall have to pay for it; and if I want a gift, I shall have to plead for it; and, according to the means I employ, the watch is stolen property, my own property, or a donation.\n\nGandhi designed satyagraha not just to be a tactic that might be useful in a particular struggle, but to be a solvent that dissolves injustice generally.\n“This force,” Gandhi wrote, “is to violence, and, therefore, to all tyranny, all injustice, what light is to darkness.”\n\nGandhi seemed at times to be promoting something like the “conservation of energy” principle in physics—as if there were a law of nature that if you add anger or violence to a situation, even in the service of justice, that anger and violence will end up reemerging as additional injustice somewhere down the line.\nOnly through satyagraha can you be sure you’re working for the good guys and not just making a bad situation worse.\nThe satyagrahi eagerly, even masochistically, absorbs the harm inflicted by others, without retaliation or even resentment, and thereby retires that injustice for good.\n\nViolent, coercive, or humiliating resistance tactics have certain pitfalls.\nFor instance:\n\n* They might be applied unwisely or against the wrong targets, thereby causing injustice rather than relieving it.\n* They might cause such anguish or resentment in their victims as to provoke additional injustice on their part.\n* They might encourage habits of violence, coercion, or humiliation in those who use them that would lead to injustice later.\n* If they fail to achieve their intended result, they will have just added to the world’s suffering without anything to show for it.\n\nThe genius of satyagraha is that it is less-plagued by such “collateral damage,” and it is very difficult to use in the service of an unjust cause, even by the unscrupulous or unwise.\n\nUnderstandably, Gandhi, though he considered satyagraha “so simple that it can be preached even to children,” was frequently troubled by campaigns that went awry due to his followers’ imprecise understanding of (or uncertain faith in) the technique.\nHe had to pay a lot of attention to education and discipline, especially as his mass campaigns in India developed.\nThe full satyagraha vows were almost monastic in tone.\n\nBut Gandhi was confident enough in his methods that he led campaigns of resisters whose understanding was weak and whose training was incomplete.\nHe did not feel the need to wait until his ideal was fully realized before acting, but hoped instead to realize his ideal in part through action and experimentation.\nIt would be a shame if the lesson people took from Gandhi was that they should become saints first, and do good afterwards.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Hannah Arendt, in \u003Ci>Between Past and Future\u003C/i>, described political “authority” this way:\n  > Since authority always demands obedience, it is commonly taken for some form of power or violence. Yet authority precludes the use of external means of coercion; where force is used, authority itself has failed. Authority, on the other hand, is incompatible with persuasion, which presupposes equality and works through a process of argumentation. Where arguments are used, authority is left in abeyance. Against the egalitarian order of persuasion stands the authoritarian order, which is always hierarchical. If authority is to be defined at all, then, it must be in contradistinction to both coercion by force and persuasion through arguments.\n* I base my guesses about how Gandhi would apply his theories to the American civil rights campaign on how Gandhi advised the satyagrahis engaged in a campaign against the policy of excluding “untouchables” from the Vykom temple. One wrote to him asking whether they should consider blockading the temple and preventing orthodox Hindus from entering until they allowed “untouchables” to worship there. Gandhi responded, in part:\n  > Such blocking the way will be sheer compulsion… [The word] Satyagraha is often most loosely used and is made to cover veiled violence. But as the author of the word I may be allowed to say that it excludes every form of violence, direct or indirect, veiled or unveiled, and whether in thought, word or deed… Satyagraha is gentle, it never wounds. It must not be the result of anger or malice. It is never fussy, never impatient, never vociferous. It is the direct opposite of compulsion. It was conceived as a complete substitute for violence.\n\n  On the other hand, Gandhi endorsed sit-ins at the blockades where police were preventing “untouchables” and their supporters from approaching the temple—these sit-ins were not coercive, but were reactions to the illegitimate coercion of the police. It is guesswork to try to draw analogies to the U.S. civil rights movement, but I can imagine Gandhi using similar logic to endorse the bus boycott or the Selma to Montgomery marches, for instance, but not the lunch counter sit-ins.\n* Gandhi, M.K. “Satyagraha vs. Passive Resistance” \u003Ci>Satyagraha in South Africa\u003C/i> (1928), quoting William Hoskens\n* Gandhi, M.K. “The Birth of

or monarchical decision-making process by temporary consensus.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But at the large-scale political level, even a 100% persuasive origin can perhaps evolve (or devolve) into an authority-based state.\nThis is the mythical origin of Hobbes’s Leviathan, of Robert Nozick’s minimal state, and various other creatures of political philosophy in-between.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Outside of philosophy, things are typically more mixed:\nFor example, the Federalist Papers were a measure of persuasion that prepared Americans to be ruled by their emerging federal government, and the military repression of various unpersuaded Americans (for instance in the Whiskey Rebellion) was a measure of coercion.\nMixed together with many other ingredients, of such a recipe was the American republic made, and it is the relatively high proportion of persuasion in that mix that gives its founding such a good reputation in some quarters.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One way of looking at political authority is as a mixture of coercion and persuasion that is held in reserve:\nan energy that is potential, rather than kinetic—like a battery.\nAnother physical metaphor is to consider authority as the momentum built up through the application of coercion and persuasion, such that the momentum itself has the same sort of power that the original coercion and persuasion did.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The momentum of authority allows the government to coast:\n“We could persuade you, but you are already persuaded, remember?\nWe could compel you, but you are already compelled, remember?”\nMeanwhile its subjects feel persuaded without knowing quite which arguments persuaded them, and feel compelled without ever feeling the grip on their shoulders or the bayonet at their backs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If a government’s authority is challenged, it will temporarily retrench into a position from which it can unleash its potential political energy as kinetic political energy and thereby remove the challenge.\nIt will use the tools of coercion and persuasion that it has kept in reserve.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this way, nonviolent resistance can make visible the hidden violence of authoritarian coercion.\nBy challenging the authority of the government, you call its bluff and force it to reveal its hand.\nIf it has a strong persuasive hand, well, there you go, and maybe you’re even persuaded.\nIf it has a strong coercive hand, suddenly people begin to feel its tight grip on their shoulders.\nIf neither hand is strong, suddenly this too is exposed, and the power-behind-the-throne is revealed to be not so powerful after all.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For this reason it may be important and useful for you to force the government to retrench from authority to its more concrete basis in coercion and persuasion, even if you do not have the power to overcome it once it has retrenched.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The danger is that if you challenge the government to drop its mask of authority and show you the fangs of coercion that lie behind it, you might very well get bit.\nAnd the stronger and more effective your challenge to authority is, the more vicious will be the government’s reaction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The more benign the government you challenge, the more it will try to retreat into a stance dominated by persuasion over coercion.\nThe more malign it is, the more eagerly it will bring out the hardware.\nBut the paradox is that the longer you wait and the more malevolent the government becomes, the more dangerous it becomes to challenge it, while at the same time such a challenge becomes more imperative.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The way out of this dilemma is to be quicker to challenge political authority (and this means saying “no” to its commands, not merely grumbling “I disapprove” to its heralds)—and to make this challenge at the first sign that authority is misused, rather than waiting until it has become so tyrannical that it knows no limits.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"ineffectiveness-is-not-a-nonviolent-tactic\">Ineffectiveness Is Not a Nonviolent Tactic\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Some people think nonviolent action is perversely self-sabotaging—like fighting with one hand tied behind your back.\nIf you were really serious about winning, they believe, you wouldn’t be so foolish as to surrender some of the tools in your toolkit before the struggle even begins.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think this argument has arisen less because nonviolent action is inherently flawed, and more because many activists and activist groups have used “nonviolence” as their excuse for choosing ineffective tactics that don’t involve much risk (particularly the risk of success).\nThe American anti-war movement, for instance, is plagued by groups that insist on repeating the same set of toothless tactics that have consistently failed to make any headway, almost as though failure has become such an ingrained tradition that it’s taboo to question it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In reaction to this are the violent, “black bloc”-style protesters and the anti-nonviolence theoreticians like Derrick Jensen or Ward Churchill.\nThey see nonviolent protest as a pathetic and timid pleading to an unresponsive and hostile government—symbolic rather than direct, predictable (and predictably ineffective), self-aggrandizing, hobbyish, and effectively collaborationist with political authority and therefore violent by proxy—ultimately, no better than the electoral process at generating real change.\nAnd they’re not willing to go along with the well-worn techniques of losing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For a movement dedicated to nonviolence to withstand such challenges, it must not mistake a non-confrontational action for a non-violent one, or confuse making an “incredibly powerful statement” with making progress.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>People who are committed to nonviolence and who want to discourage violence in their campaigns should ask how Gandhi prevented the Indian National Congress from choosing the tactics of those in India who were advocating armed insurrection.\nThe answer: he was more hard-core than they were, and he demonstrated results.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"satyagraha\">Satyagraha\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Deliberate, principled, Gandhi-style nonviolence not only can be an effective technique of political force, but it includes

if I want to buy your watch, I shall have to pay for it; and if I want a gift, I shall have to plead for it; and, according to the means I employ, the watch is stolen property, my own property, or a donation.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Gandhi designed satyagraha not just to be a tactic that might be useful in a particular struggle, but to be a solvent that dissolves injustice generally.\n“This force,” Gandhi wrote, “is to violence, and, therefore, to all tyranny, all injustice, what light is to darkness.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Gandhi seemed at times to be promoting something like the “conservation of energy” principle in physics—as if there were a law of nature that if you add anger or violence to a situation, even in the service of justice, that anger and violence will end up reemerging as additional injustice somewhere down the line.\nOnly through satyagraha can you be sure you’re working for the good guys and not just making a bad situation worse.\nThe satyagrahi eagerly, even masochistically, absorbs the harm inflicted by others, without retaliation or even resentment, and thereby retires that injustice for good.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Violent, coercive, or humiliating resistance tactics have certain pitfalls.\nFor instance:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>They might be applied unwisely or against the wrong targets, thereby causing injustice rather than relieving it.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>They might cause such anguish or resentment in their victims as to provoke additional injustice on their part.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>They might encourage habits of violence, coercion, or humiliation in those who use them that would lead to injustice later.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>If they fail to achieve their intended result, they will have just added to the world’s suffering without anything to show for it.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>The genius of satyagraha is that it is less-plagued by such “collateral damage,” and it is very difficult to use in the service of an unjust cause, even by the unscrupulous or unwise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Understandably, Gandhi, though he considered satyagraha “so simple that it can be preached even to children,” was frequently troubled by campaigns that went awry due to his followers’ imprecise understanding of (or uncertain faith in) the technique.\nHe had to pay a lot of attention to education and discipline, especially as his mass campaigns in India developed.\nThe full satyagraha vows were almost monastic in tone.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But Gandhi was confident enough in his methods that he led campaigns of resisters whose understanding was weak and whose training was incomplete.\nHe did not feel the need to wait until his ideal was fully realized before acting, but hoped instead to realize his ideal in part through action and experimentation.\nIt would be a shame if the lesson people took from Gandhi was that they should become saints first, and do good afterwards.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Hannah Arendt, in \u003Ci>Between Past and Future\u003C/i>, described political “authority” this way:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Since authority always demands obedience, it is commonly taken for some form of power or violence. Yet authority precludes the use of external means of coercion; where force is used, authority itself has failed. Authority, on the other hand, is incompatible with persuasion, which presupposes equality and works through a process of argumentation. Where arguments are used, authority is left in abeyance. Against the egalitarian order of persuasion stands the authoritarian order, which is always hierarchical.

One wrote to him asking whether they should consider blockading the temple and preventing orthodox Hindus from entering until they allowed “untouchables” to worship there. Gandhi responded, in part:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Such blocking the way will be sheer compulsion… [The word] Satyagraha is often most loosely used and is made to cover veiled violence. But as the author of the word I may be allowed to say that it excludes every form of violence, direct or indirect, veiled or unveiled, and whether in thought, word or deed… Satyagraha is gentle, it never wounds. It must not be the result of anger or malice. It is never fussy, never impatient, never vociferous. It is the direct opposite of compulsion. It was conceived as a complete substitute for violence.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>On the other hand, Gandhi endorsed sit-ins at the blockades where police were preventing “untouchables” and their supporters from approaching the temple—these sit-ins were not coercive, but were reactions to the illegitimate coercion of the police. It is guesswork to try to draw analogies to the U.S. civil rights movement, but I can imagine Gandhi using similar logic to endorse the bus boycott or the Selma to Montgomery marches, for instance, but not the lunch counter sit-ins.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Gandhi, M.K. “Satyagraha vs. Passive Resistance” \u003Ci>Satyagraha in South Africa\u003C/i> (1928), quoting William Hoskens\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Gandhi, M.K. “The Birth of Satyagraha” \u003Ci>An Autobiography: Or, My Experiments with the Truth\u003C/i> (1940)\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Gandhi, M.K. “Means and Ends” in \u003Ci>Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)\u003C/i> (1961), pp. 4–15\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Gandhi, M.K. “The Theory and Practice of Satyagraha” in \u003Ci>Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)\u003C/i> (1961), pp. 34–36\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/details>",{"headings":187,"localImagePaths":197,"remoteImagePaths":198,"frontmatter":199,"imagePaths":201},[188,191,194],{"depth":54,"slug":189,"text":190},"authority","Authority",{"depth":54,"slug":192,"text":193},"ineffectiveness-is-not-a-nonviolent-tactic","Ineffectiveness Is Not a Nonviolent Tactic",{"depth":54,"slug":195,"text":196},"satyagraha","Satyagraha",[182],[],{"title":174,"description":175,"sidebar":200},{"order":54},[182],"tacticsofeducationandpublicrelations/conductsurveys",{"id":202,"data":204,"body":211,"filePath":212,"digest":213,"rendered":214},{"title":205,"description":206,"editUrl":16,"head":207,"template":52,"sidebar":208,"pagefind":16,"draft":39},"Conduct Surveys to Gauge Support","Some movements have also found that conducting surveys allows for outreach that has a value beyond that of collecting information.",[],{"order":209,"hidden":39,"attrs":210},5,{},"By conducting surveys, tax resistance movements can gauge how willing people might be to join or support a resistance campaign and can also more-confidently reassure potential resisters that they will not be alone.\nSome movements have also found that conducting surveys allows for outreach that has a value beyond that of collecting information.\n\nOpponents of a new water charge in Dublin were told by the government that they were a radical fringe of unrepresentative malcontents and that most citizens supported the new tax.\nThe Secretary of the Federation of Dublin Anti Water Charge Campaigns remembers:\n\n> Our immediate response was to challenge his contention and to propose a survey of the area to find out what people really thought, and a further public meeting to report the findings.

because they were able to contrast their nonviolent “passive resistance” tactics with those of the “militant” wing of the women’s suffrage movement, whose members used arson, assault, and other violent tactics.\nMary Russell, when she began resisting her property tax, said:\n“I am very strongly opposed to the militant tactics adopted by a portion of those who are in favour of women’s franchise, and I have therefore taken this, the only course open to me, which appears justifiable, of protesting against the way in which the question of woman suffrage has been treated by the Government.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the United States the women’s suffrage movement was considerably more restrained.\nThere was no significant “militant” wing to act as the bad cop to the tax resisters’ good cop.\nThis may have contributed to the slower adoption of tax resistance there.\nOne American suffragist, commenting on Mary Russell’s resistance, noted that “this was [her] manner of protesting against militancy, though I fancy we should have considered it rather militant here.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and

Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nThe Bardoli tax strike was media savvy, both in its use of preexisting media, and in its innovative use of local, down-to-earth outreach methods.\nMahadev Desai wrote:\n\n> A campaign like this could not be carried out without a publicity department. The peasants could not be asked to subscribe to daily papers or even to the weekly \u003Ci>Navajivan\u003C/i>, and outside papers could at best give an outside view of the campaign.… The arrangement was to issue a daily news bulletin and publish Sjt. Vallabhbhai’s speeches in pamphlet form and to distribute them free to the agriculturalists all over the taluka.… The arrangement answered most admirably, the villagers waiting anxiously for the \u003Ci>patrikas\u003C/i> [pamphlets] every morning and devouring the contents with avidity. All the Gujarati and almost all the English dailies of Bombay reproduced them \u003Ci>verbatim\u003C/i>, and as the movement gathered force, every important town and village in Gujarat began to get copies of the bulletin with the result that over and above ten thousand copies distributed in Bardoli, four thousand copies were subscribed to by places outside.\n\nBecause the movement relied on its own periodical literature, it also needed its own team to handle distribution.\nThis was laborious work, but the movement could take advantage of it for two-way communication and for intelligence gathering.\nIn the course of describing the organizational structure of the nonviolent resistance army, Desai noted:\n\n> [U]nder these officers were privates ready to march anywhere and everywhere, at any hour of the night and day, and ready to do the lowliest of duties, from carrying a message to drawing water from the well.… The round of duties of most of them began often as early as 3 A.M., when they started with their orders for the day to the various villages where they would distribute the daily news bulletins issued by the Publicity Bureau.… All were to go amongst the peasants, acquaint themselves with their needs and difficulties, cheer them up, and explain to them the instructions of the Chief…\n\nThe commander of the tax strike was “ever on the move” delivering pep talks and propaganda in person, “often at midnight, and often at three or four places in a day.”\n\n> The Bardoli victory was not won by a miracle. It was the inevitable fruit of patient and incessant toil, the inevitable result of the teaching that the Sardar wore himself out to impart day in and day out. During the first two months he gave three days in the week to Bardoli, but as soon as the Ahmedabad Municipality released him, all his waking hours were given to the people of Bardoli, the day usually beginning at 5 P.M. and ending at 2 A.M., with four or five speeches a day on average.\n\n## Valentine Byler\n\nThe case of Valentine Byler, an Amish man who refused to participate in the American Social Security system for religious reasons, was remarkable for how it played out in the media.\nPart of this was due to the heavy-handedness of the IRS, which seized Byler’s horses out from under him as he was working his field.\nAsked about this, the IRS Chief of Collections said: “Plowing never occurred to me. I live in an apartment.”\n\nThe frame of thoughtless-urban-bureaucrats vs. godly-heartland-people attached itself to the story, and those editorialists across the country who were already skeptical of welfare state policies jumped on it.\n“What kind of ‘welfare’ is it,” editorialized the \u003Ci>New York Herald Tribune\u003C/i>, “that takes a farmer’s horses away at spring plowing time in order to dragoon a whole community into a ‘benefit’ scheme it neither needs nor wants, and which offends its deeply held religious scruples?”\n\nAs a result of press like this, Byler got letters of support from around the country.\nCongress eventually felt enough of the pressure that it carved out a legal exception for self-employed Amish people that exempts them from the Social Security law.\n\n## Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nAbby and Julia Smith were taxed excessively by an unscrupulous local government that they, as women, had no voice in electing.\nThey decided to resist, and they knew how to make their struggle attractive to the news media.\n\nJulia prepared a speech for the town council that fell on deaf ears—but she then released the text to the editor of a nearby newspaper, which reprinted it and compared the sisters to the American Revolutionaries who fought for the principle of “no taxation without representation.”\nAn accompanying editorial concluded:\n“It will not be creditable if Abby Smith and her sister are left to stand alone… to fight the battle of principle unaided.”\n\nSure enough, they received aid—rhetorical and practical—from many quarters.\n“[M]uch of the nation’s interest in the Glastonbury case was the work of Abby,” wrote Elizabeth George Speare in recapping the case, “who willingly took pen in hand to keep her public informed.\n…she seems to have welcomed every opportunity to recount, in her pungent style, a tale which lost nothing in constant retelling.”\n\nThe Women’s Tax Resistance League in Britain made sure to have speeches and propaganda ready to deliver at events like tax auctions that the media might cover.\nSuch speeches might become the core of a reporter’s coverage of such an event.\nDora Montefiore recalled how she and some of her fellow-activists worked to turn the “siege” of her home into a media phenomenon:\n\n> In 1904 and 1905 a bailiff had been put in my house, a levy of my goods had been made, and they had been sold at public auction in Hammersmith. The result as far as publicity was concerned was half a dozen lines in the corner of some daily newspapers…\n>\n> When talking this over in 1906 with Theresa Billington and Annie Kenney, I told them that now we had the organisation of the W.S.P.U. [Women’s Social and Political Union] to back me up I would, if it were thought advisable, not only refuse to pay income tax, but would shut and bar my doors and keep out the bailiff, so as to give the demonstration more publicity and thus help to educate public opinion about the fight for the political emancipation of women which was going on. They agreed that if I would do my share of passive resistance they would hold daily demonstrations outside the house as long as the bailiff was excluded and do all in their power outside to make the sacrifice I was making of value to the cause.…\n>\n> …From the day of this simple act of closing my door against the bailiff, an extraordinary change came over the publicity department of daily and weekly journalism towards this demonstration of passive resistance on my part…\n>\n> On the morning following the inauguration of the siege, Annie Kenney and Theresa Billington, with other members of the W.S.P.U., came round to see how we were getting on and to encourage our resistance. They were still chatting from the pavement outside, while I stood on the steps of No. 32 Upper Mall, when there crept round from all sides men with notebooks and men with cameras, and the publicity stunt began. These men had been watching furtively the coming and going of postmen and tradesmen. Now they posted themselves in front, questioning the suffragists outside and asking for news of us inside. They had come to make a “story” and they did not intend to leave until they had got their “story.” One of them returned soon with a loaf of bread and asked Annie Kenney to hand it up over the wall to my housekeeper, whilst the army of men with cameras “snapped” the incident. Some of them wanted to climb over the wall so as to be able to boast in their descriptions that they had been inside what they pleased to call “The Fort”; but the policeman outside (there was a policeman on duty outside during all the six weeks of a siege) warned them that they must not do this so we were relieved, in this respect, from the too close attention of eager pressmen. But all through the morning notebooks and cameras came and went, and at one time my housekeeper and I counted no less than twenty-two pressmen outside the house. A woman sympathiser in the neighbourhood brought during the course of the morning, a pot of home-made marmalade, as the story had got abroad that we had no provisions and had difficulty in obtaining food. This was never the case as I am a good housekeeper and have always kept a store cupboard, but we accepted with thanks the pot of marmalade because the intentions of the giver were so excellent; but this incident was also watched and reported by the Press.580\n\n## First Intifada\n\nWhen I read stories from newspaper archives about the tax strike in Beit Sahour during the first intifada, I’m struck with how much more sympathetic the American press was toward the Palestinian people at that time.\nThey are depicted as human beings, with families and aspirations, and their grievances are taken seriously and explored and analyzed and given credence.\nThe contrast with the coverage in today’s media is stark.\n\nThis can partially be explained by the fact that most of the resisters there were Palestinian \u003Cem>Christians\u003C/em>, and so did not trigger the anti-Muslim bias that shapes much of the English-language reporting from the area (one news account, for example, made much of the fact that the Israeli military had seized “Christian crosses carved of olivewood and the statuettes of the Good Shepherd and the Madonna” from one resister).\n\nBut the resisters in Beit Sahour were also very deliberately media savvy:\nthey stuck to nonviolent tactics, which, besides being tactically sensible under the circumstances, also made the expected draconian Israeli crackdown seem particularly bullying; and they used slogans, like “no taxation without representation” that fell on sympathetic ears in the English-speaking world.\nA reporter noted, pointedly, that when the Israeli military lifted its siege of Beit Sahour, “hundreds of residents gathered at a central intersection to celebrate and to escort journalists to homes and shops from which troops had seized goods.”\n\n## Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nDuring the campaign against Margaret Thatcher’s poll tax, the resistance movement successfully depicted the government’s tax as being particularly harmful to pensioners, the disabled, student nurses, families with live-in elderly relatives, and other such victims, in a way that made for a sympathetic media narrative.\n“Stories like this flooded both the national and local media,” writes movement historian Danny Burns. “One minute the focus was on the nurses, next on the disabled, then on the pensioners.”\n\n## American War Tax Resisters\n\nThe IRS pursues a publicity strategy in coordination with its enforcement actions, and it grades itself by how much press coverage it gets when it cracks down on a tax evader—“sending the message to taxpayers that violations of the Internal Revenue Code and related financial crimes are being investigated and prosecuted.”\nOne study estimated that for every dollar the government wins directly as the result of a well-publicized criminal tax conviction, it gets sixteen dollars from people who are scared into tax compliance by hearing the news.\n\nFor this reason the IRS tries to make sure the press is alerted about any criminal tax cases it thinks it will win.\nAnd of course the agency gives out its own spin on the case when it does so.\nSo it makes sense for tax resisters to be prepared with their own messages on such occasions.\n\n“Never let a lien, levy, seizure, auction, summons, Order to Show Cause, or indictment pass without taking the opportunity to publicize opposition,” advise the authors of the book \u003Ci>War Tax Resistance: A Guide to Withholding Your Support from the Military\u003C/i>.\n“The IRS is very sensitive to adverse public opinion. It is probably the most disliked agency of the government.\nYou may be surprised at the amount of support and sympathy you will get from the general public and media when struggling against the IRS—if you take care to organize properly.”\n\n## The Addiopizzo Movement\n\nHere is another example of activists creating their own media as the springboard for a public relations campaign.\nThe Addiopizzo movement, which is trying to get businesses in Sicily to stop paying \u003Ci>pizzo\u003C/i> taxes to the mafia, started with a clever propaganda campaign in Palermo that was well-designed to get tongues wagging:\n\n> [T]he group printed large stickers. Designed to mimic the look of traditional Sicilian obituary notices, they bore one sentence: “An entire people that pays \u003Ci>pizzo\u003C/i> is a people without dignity.”\n>\n> Residents woke on June 29, 2004, to find the stickers plastered in the city’s core. The slogan suggested the death of their dignity for accepting the system of \u003Ci>pizzo\u003C/i>.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Desai, Mahadev \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i> (1929) pp. 57–58, 163–64, 168\n* Igou, Brad “Valentine Byler vs. the IRS: ‘Pay Unto Caesar—The Amish & Social Security’ ” \u003Ci>Amish Country News\u003C/i> 1999\n* Speare, Elizabeth George “Abby, Julia, and the Cows” \u003Ci>American Heritage\u003C/i> June 1957\n* Montefiore, Dora \u003Ci>From a Victorian to a Modern\u003C/i> (1925) chapter VI\n* Cowell, Alan “Beit Sahur Journal: In a Tax War, Even the Olivewood Dove Is Seized” \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> 11 October 1989\n* “Israel lifts siege on tax town” \u003Ci>The Glasgow Herald\u003C/i> 1 November 1989, p. 4\n* Burns, Danny \u003Ci>Poll Tax Rebellion\u003C/i> AK Press (1992), p. 19\n* Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration “Statistical Portrayal of the Criminal Investigation Function’s Enforcement Activities From Fiscal Year 2000 Through Fiscal Year 2006” 6 June 2007.

This was never the case as I am a good housekeeper and have always kept a store cupboard, but we accepted with thanks the pot of marmalade because the intentions of the giver were so excellent; but this incident was also watched and reported by the Press.580\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"first-intifada\">First Intifada\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>When I read stories from newspaper archives about the tax strike in Beit Sahour during the first intifada, I’m struck with how much more sympathetic the American press was toward the Palestinian people at that time.\nThey are depicted as human beings, with families and aspirations, and their grievances are taken seriously and explored and analyzed and given credence.\nThe contrast with the coverage in today’s media is stark.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This can partially be explained by the fact that most of the resisters there were Palestinian \u003Cem>Christians\u003C/em>, and so did not trigger the anti-Muslim bias that shapes much of the English-language reporting from the area (one news account, for example, made much of the fact that the Israeli military had seized “Christian crosses carved of olivewood and the statuettes of the Good Shepherd and the Madonna” from one resister).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But the resisters in Beit Sahour were also very deliberately media savvy:\nthey stuck to nonviolent tactics, which, besides being tactically sensible under the circumstances, also made the expected draconian Israeli crackdown seem particularly bullying; and they used slogans, like “no taxation without representation” that fell on sympathetic ears in the English-speaking world.\nA reporter noted, pointedly, that when the Israeli military lifted its siege of Beit Sahour, “hundreds of residents gathered at a central intersection to celebrate and to escort journalists to homes and shops from which troops had seized goods.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"poll-tax-rebellion\">Poll Tax Rebellion\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>During the campaign against Margaret Thatcher’s poll tax, the resistance movement successfully depicted the government’s tax as being particularly harmful to pensioners, the disabled, student nurses, families with live-in elderly relatives, and other such victims, in a way that made for a sympathetic media narrative.\n“Stories like this flooded both the national and local media,” writes movement historian Danny Burns. “One minute the focus was on the nurses, next on the disabled, then on the pensioners.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"american-war-tax-resisters\">American War Tax Resisters\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The IRS pursues a publicity strategy in coordination with its enforcement actions, and it grades itself by how much press coverage it gets when it cracks down on a tax evader—“sending the message to taxpayers that violations of the Internal Revenue Code and related financial crimes are being investigated and prosecuted.”\nOne study estimated that for every dollar the government wins directly as the result of a well-publicized criminal tax conviction, it gets sixteen dollars from people who are scared into tax compliance by hearing the news.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For this reason the IRS tries to make sure the press is alerted about any criminal tax cases it thinks it will win.\nAnd of course the agency gives out its own spin on the case when it does so.\nSo it makes sense for tax resisters to be prepared with their own messages on such occasions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Never let a lien, levy, seizure, auction, summons, Order to Show Cause, or indictment pass without taking the opportunity to publicize opposition,” advise the authors of the book \u003Ci>War Tax Resistance: A Guide to Withholding Your Support from the Military\u003C/i>.\n“The IRS is very sensitive to adverse public opinion.

Honesty provides a stark moral contrast between your campaign and whatever institution you are opposing.\n\nIn \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i>, Mahadev Desai described how this played out in the Bardoli tax strike:\n\n> …a regular propaganda of mendacity was resorted to [by the Government]. The Government’s way and the people’s way presented a striking study in contrasts. On one side there were secrecy, underhand dealings, falsehood, even sharp practice; on the other there were straight and manly speech, and straight action in broad daylight.\n\nThis contrast can make your campaign more appealing to potential resisters and to bystanders, and can increase the morale of the resisters in your campaign.\n\n## 2. Honesty itself is a threat to tyranny.\n\nThe way people signal their loyalty to tyranny is to participate in the lies that bolster its power.\nWhen everyone around you goes along with the lies, it feels like everyone is loyal to the tyrant.\nCzech dissident Václav Havel wrote of how this worked under communist tyranny:\n\n> Individuals need not believe all these mystifications, but they must behave as though they did, or they must at least tolerate them in silence, or get along well with those who work with them. For this reason, however, they must live \u003Cem>within a lie\u003C/em>. They need not accept the lie. It is enough for them to have accepted their life with it and in it. For by this very fact, individuals confirm the system, fulfil the system, make the system, \u003Cem>are\u003C/em> the system.\n\nBut, he said, people may start to refuse:\n\n> Living within the lie can constitute the system only if it is universal. The principle must embrace and permeate everything. There are no terms whatsoever on which it can coexist with living within the truth, and therefore everyone who steps out of line \u003Cem>denies it in principle and threatens it in its entirety\u003C/em>.\n\nTolstoy went further, and claimed that radical honesty not only threatens tyrants but constitutes a revolution:\n\n> No feats of heroism are needed to achieve the greatest and most important changes in the existence of humanity; neither the armament of millions of soldiers, nor the construction of new roads and machines, nor the arrangement of exhibitions, nor the organization of workmen’s unions, nor revolutions, nor barricades, nor explosions, nor the perfection of aërial navigation; but a change in public opinion.\n>\n> And to accomplish this change no exertions of the mind are needed, nor the refutation of anything in existence, nor the invention of any extraordinary novelty; it is only needful that we should not succumb to the erroneous, already defunct, public opinion of the past, which governments have induced artificially; it is only needful that each individual should say what he really feels or thinks, or at least that he should not say what he does not think.\n>\n> And if only a small body of the people were to do so at once, of their own accord, outworn public opinion would fall off us of itself, and a new, living, real opinion would assert itself. And when public opinion should thus have changed without the slightest effort, the internal condition of men’s lives which so torments them would change likewise of its own accord.\n>\n> One is ashamed to say how little is needed for all men to be delivered from those calamities which now oppress them; it is only needful not to lie.\n\n## 3. Honesty keeps your campaign from deluding itself.\n\nIn a tax resistance campaign, as in any activist campaign, there are frequently temptations to take short-cuts.\nRather than winning a victory after a tough and uncertain struggle, you can \u003Cem>declare\u003C/em> victory early and hope to capitalize on the resulting morale boost.\nOr, rather than doing something practical that takes a lot of thankless hours, you can do something quick and symbolic that “makes a powerful statement.”\nOr, rather than fighting for goals that are worth achieving, you can pick goals that are easily achievable but that aren’t really worth fighting for.\n\nRadical honesty gets you in the habit of avoiding temptations like these.\nBy facing your situation forthrightly, and by evaluating your tactics unflinchingly and without self-flattery, you become more apt to make effective decisions.\n\n## 4. Honesty is itself a good thing worth contributing to.\n\nIf you conduct your campaign in a radically honest way, you contribute to a cultural atmosphere of trust and straightforward communication.\nIn this way, even if you do not succeed in the other goals of your tax resistance campaign, you still may have some residual positive effect on the world around you.\n\n## 5. Honesty means there’s a lot you no longer have to worry about.\n\nWhen you practice radical honesty, you don’t have to worry about keeping your stories straight, you don’t have to worry about leaks of information that might cast doubt on your credibility, you don’t have to be as concerned about information security, and you don’t have to worry about spies and informers in your midst who might blab your secrets to the authorities.\nThis leaves you free to spend your energy and attention playing offense instead of defense.\n\nWhen Gandhi heard concerns that government agents had infiltrated the Indian independence movement, he wrote:\n\n> This desire for secrecy has bred cowardice amongst us and has made us dissemble our speech. The best and the quickest way of getting rid of this corroding and degrading Secret Service is for us to make a final effort to think everything aloud, have no privileged conversation with any soul on earth and to cease to fear the spy. We must ignore his presence and treat everyone as a friend entitled to know all our thoughts and plans. I know that I have achieved most satisfactory results from evolving the boldest of my plans in broad daylight. I have never lost a minute’s peace for having detectives by my side. The public may not know that I have been shadowed throughout my stay in India. That has not only not worried me but I have even taken friendly services from these gentlemen: many have apologized for having to shadow me. As a rule, what I have spoken in their presence has already been published to the world. The result is that now I do not even notice the presence of these men and I do not know that the Government is much the wiser for having watched my movements through its secret agency.\n\n## What’s the catch?\n\nWhat’s the catch?\nFor one thing, for a campaign to be radically honest it needs to have fairly tight control over its message.\nNot just anyone can be a spokesperson, but only those with the talent to speak precisely and to cut through the sorts of baloney that characterize political debate in this era of spin doctors and pundits and talking points.\n\nAnother difficulty is that if your campaign already has a credibility problem, it’s going to take a lot of radical honesty to dig you out of that hole.\n\nAlso, it seems that at least some of the benefits of radical honesty only emerge when it has become really radical and pervasive.\nHalf-hearted gestures of radical honesty are just another form of machiavellian communication.\nIf you’re not prepared to go all the way, it may not be to your advantage to put in the extra effort.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Sissela Bok’s \u003Ci>Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life\u003C/i> (1989) has some good food for thought on this subject.\n  Bok thinks that there are some good excuses for lying, but that in general people tend to be far too willing to justify lies, and that their justifications typically don’t stand up to scrutiny.\n  Even the more sophisticated ethical defenses of lying tend to look only at the isolated instance of the particular lie and its effect on the person or persons being directly deceived.\n  Bok makes a good case for why we also need to take into account the effects of the lie on the character of the liar, on the culture of communication and trust, and on bystanders.\n* It’s not just activist campaigns that can suffer from self-delusion, of course.\n  For example, during the Vietnam war, war-theorists working for the United States government cleverly created simulations and projections for victory using the best data they had at their disposal—but this data was being systematically falsified by other elements of the government who were using deceit tactically as their own best guess as how to win the war.\n  In this way these lies doubled-back and amplified the defeat and shame of the American war on Vietnam.\n* Desai, Mahadev \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i> (1929) p. 94\n* Havel, Václav “The Power of the Powerless” (1978); Another good essay on this theme is Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s “Not To Live By Falsehood” (1974).\n* Tolstoy, Leo \u003Ci>Patriotism and Christianity\u003C/i> (1896) pp. 48–49\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/docs/tacticsofeducationandpublicrelations/radicalhonesty.md","44228d202a0b13b3",{"html":343,"metadata":344},"\u003Cp>Your tax resistance campaign might benefit from adopting the tactic of radical honesty.\nRadical honesty means abjuring subterfuge—conducting your campaign in the open, in plain sight, without trying to take your opponent by surprise through trickery, and without trying to influence people by “spin” and lopsided propaganda.\nIt also means studiously refusing to participate in the dishonesty by which your opponent holds on to power and deceives those who submit to it.\nRadical honesty has several potential advantages:\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"1-honesty-provides-a-stark-moral-contrast-between-your-campaign-and-whatever-institution-you-are-opposing\">1.

And in my letter to the IRS I said: “I’m not refusing to pay my taxes. I’m actually paying them but I’m paying them where they belong because you refuse to do so.” They are not directing our money where it should be going, they are being horrific stewards of that money.\n\nNWTRCC organized what it called the “War Tax Boycott” in 2008.\nIt encouraged war tax resisters across the country to coordinate by redirecting their refused taxes to either of two groups:\none that provided healthcare in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and one that helped Iraq War refugees.\nThe campaign kept track of how much money had been redirected over the course of the boycott, and then held a press conference to give oversized checks adding up to about $325,000 to spokespeople for these campaigns.\n\nThe People’s Life Fund is associated with the group Northern California War Tax Resistance, and holds redirected taxes from resisters.\nIf the IRS successfully seizes money from a resister, that resister can reclaim his or her deposits to the Fund.\nOtherwise, the money remains there and earns interest and dividends.\nEvery year the group pools these returns on investment and gives them away to local charitable organizations in a granting ceremony.\nUsually these grants are modest—$500 or $1,000 each—but they give them to a dozen or more groups, which makes their granting ceremonies a good way for local charities to network with each other and helps the word about war tax resistance spread in the local activist community.\nThis same model, or one similar to it, is followed by a number of regional redirection funds associated with war tax resistance groups in the United States.\n\nA war tax resistance group in Iowa used the proceeds from its redirection fund to create a scholarship for college students who had been banned from applying for government financial aid because of their refusal to register for the draft.\nAnother, in Pennsylvania, made an interest-free loan to a legal defense group that was supporting a group of draft resisters who were on trial.\nThese actions helped to forge or sustain ties between the war tax resistance movement and anti-conscription activists and gave war tax resistance a higher profile in the larger anti-war movement.\n\nOne family figured out a way to get extra mileage out of their redirection:\nIn 1997 they redirected their refused federal taxes to a charitable program called “Childreach.”\nThat year, the U.S. Agency for International Development, a federal government agency, had promised to match private donations to Childreach two-to-one from its budget, so the family’s $211.69 in redirected taxes had the effect of pulling an additional $423.38 from the U.S. government for a good cause.\n\n![](../../../assets/redirection.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>war tax resister Bill Ramsey redirects $1,000 to charity in a granting ceremony\u003C/figcaption>\n\nIn 1968, war tax resister Irving Hogan stood outside the Federal Building in San Francisco and redirected his federal income tax dollars one at a time by handing them out to passers by.\n“I want this money to be used for the delight, not the destruction, of men,” he said.\n“Here: go buy yourself a beer.”\n\nJohn and Pat Schwiebert did something similar:\nThey redirected their taxes by handing out five-dollar bills to people standing in line at the unemployment office.\nAlong with the bills, they handed out letters in which they explained their redirection action.\nTo amplify the public relations impact, they notified the media of their plans ahead of time.\n“Their actions garnered them an interview on NPR,” according to one report, “and they received letters and cards from around the world.”\n\nIn 1972 a group of war tax resisters in New York redirected their war taxes as nickels that they handed out to people waiting at the bus stops on lines where fare hikes were being proposed, saying “this is where our tax dollars should be going.”\n\nArthur Evans felt that if redirecting your war taxes to charity was a good idea, redirecting twice your war taxes to charity must be twice as good.\nIn 1965 he wrote to the IRS to tell them “I am sending double the amount I am not paying for war to Quaker House at the United Nations for transmission to the United Nations Organization for its technical assistance program.”\n\nIn the early 1970s, farmers who were resisting the expansion of a military base onto their land in Larzac, France, found common cause with war tax resisters.\nThousands of war tax resisters there redirected their war taxes to help fund the Larzac struggle.\n\nAnd here’s something kind of similar that doesn’t fit into any of my other categories, so I’ll toss it in here:\nWhen the IRS seized back taxes from war tax resister Mary Regan’s retirement account in 1998, she threw a fund-raising party to try to raise an equivalent amount of money—but not in order to reimburse \u003Cem>her\u003C/em>, but to give away to charities like “the Boston Women’s Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Friends Service Committee, a homeless shelter for youth, and the peace movement in Israel.”\n\n## British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nThe Women’s Tax Resistance League largely suspended its campaign during World War I, but one woman, signing her letter “A Persistent Tax Resister” wrote to the editor of a suffragist paper to suggest that women should redirect their taxes from the government to a privately-run war relief charity “and should send her donation as ‘Taxes withheld from the Government by a voteless woman.’”\nSuffrage activist Charlotte Despard reported that “she had offered to give voluntarily the amount demanded of her by Revenue authorities to any war charity, but her offer had not been accepted.”\n\n## Social Security Foe\n\nIn 1952, Howard Pennington, unwilling to pay an $81 social security tax “for waste by socialistic dreamers,” instead sent that money directly to George Robinett.\nRobinett was a 72-year-old retiree whose social security had been abruptly cut off for three months, costing him $210, because during one month he had earned 62 cents above the $50 maximum monthly earnings for a social security recipient.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* When I presented some of my ideas about varieties of tax resisters (see [“Varieties of Tax

demonstrator dressed up in the garb of an American colonial\u003C/figcaption>\n\n### Resonances with Prior Rebellions\n\nJust about every tax revolt in the U.S. appropriates the Boston Tea Party as an evocative example of a righteous grassroots uprising.\nThe “Taxed Enough Already” TEA Party phenomenon is just one of many, many examples.\n\nIn Spain, the \u003Ci>Tancament de Caixes\u003C/i> (“shutting the cashboxes”) campaign in 1899 plays a similar role: modern Spanish tax resisters take inspiration from and compare their campaigns with that legendary struggle.\n\nIn Brittany, during the tax riots there in late 2013, “protesters wore red caps as a symbol of the Bretons’ historical resistance to taxes imposed by the ‘Sun King,’ Louis XIV.”\n\nIn England (and the British empire), the 1635 refusal by John Hampden to pay the King’s “ship money” has long been the example of choice—he has been trotted out from South Africa to Ireland to India to prove that celebrated patriots can refuse to hand over their tribute to the crown.\n\nThe phrase “no taxation without representation” has rhetorical power, especially in the nations descended from the British Empire.\nIt was especially potent in the American revolution and in the women’s suffrage movements.\nIt is sometimes used today even in support of tax resistance campaigns in which \u003Cem>representation\u003C/em> isn’t really an issue, as people have come to use the aphorism more as an incantation than a statement of principle.\n\n## Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca Rioters in Wales, who painted their faces and dressed in drag to destroy tollgates and mete out justice in the middle of the nineteenth century, were tapping into a folkloric form of grassroots vigilantism that was centuries old.\n“Jack a Lents” painted their faces and dressed in women’s clothing to tear down turnpikes in England a century before, and I’ve found references to protesters led by men in women’s clothing who used the shared pseudonym of “Lady Skimmington” in the Western Rising in England a century before that.\n\n## Robin Hood\n\nThe Robin Hood myth has taken on a tax resistance theme in recent years.\nThe Disney animated version of the Robin Hood story makes the wicked Sheriff of Nottingham a tax collector.\nRobin Hood robs him in order to redistribute the taxes back to the people they’d been seized from:\n\n> While he taxes us to pieces and he robs us of our bread\u003Cbr />\n> King Richard’s crown keeps slippin’ down around that pointed head.\u003Cbr />\n> Ah! But while there is a merry man in Robin’s wily pack,\u003Cbr />\n> We’ll find a way to make him pay and steal our money back.\n\n## Shrugging\n\n![licensed from “Fibonacci Blue” under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license](../../../assets/atlas-shrugs.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>a TEA Party demonstrator gets his message across\u003C/figcaption>\n\nAyn Rand’s novel \u003Ci>Atlas Shrugged\u003C/i> has become so influential in some quarters as to have almost graduated to the level of myth.\nThe titular metaphor has Atlas, the mythological titan who holds the world on his shoulders, shrugging and abandoning his role and leaving the world to collapse behind him.\nIn the book, Atlas is represented by the productive members of society—entrepreneurs, inventors, and good folk who do an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay.\nThey are oppressed by a majority of parasites who use the government to steal the product of productive people’s labor for the good of those whose warped values make being productive a sin and being a parasite a virtue.\nBut one by one the productive few begin to drop out of society (and out of sight), following a pied piper named John Galt to a hidden utopia called “Galt’s Gulch” where parasites are not coddled and productive people can be free to produce and to exchange the fruits of their labor.\nFinally the dystopia around them collapses as the parasites run out of hosts to feed on.\n\nSome people who believe that the dystopia in this story describes their own society to a disturbing extent have adopted the terms “shrugging” or “going Galt” to describe their own decisions to step off the taxed hamster wheel.\nBy using such shorthand terms, they are able to quickly communicate the values and motives that lead them to resist, at least to other people who are also familiar with the \u003Ci>Atlas Shrugged\u003C/i> myth.\nHere’s one example:\n\n> I sold my business, moved to Montana, shrugged and have lived comfortably near the poverty [line] since 2005. I have a friend who made seven figures a year and shrugged last year. Gulches are popping up all over this country. Just because it’s not really well known doesn’t mean it’s not happening. Most of us, myself being a bit of an outlier, keep well below the radar.\n\n## The Power of Rumor\n\nUrban legends helped to fuel tax resistance during the French Revolution.\nRumors that the King had abolished taxes led people to refuse payment or to destroy the obsolete offices and apparatus of taxation.\n\nSimilarly, in Russia, after the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, a rumor spread that the word \u003Ci>volia\u003C/i> (freedom) in the emancipation decree also freed the former-serfs from the “redemption payments, labor dues, and taxes” that plagued them.\nMany people began refusing to pay such taxes as a result, claiming that the tax collectors were maliciously concealing the good news in the czar’s decree.\n\nThe myth of the czar’s fatherly benevolence, which was promoted by the czarist government, could backfire on it.\nPeasants, operating under the theory that because the czar was so good he could not possibly have ordered such terrible things, might refuse to pay onerous taxes or to obey other commands of the czar’s subordinates.\nJames C. Scott wrote:\n\n> Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the myth was its plasticity in the hands of its peasant adherents. First and foremost, it was an invitation to resist any or all of the czar’s supposed agents, who could not have been carrying out the good czar’s wishes if they imposed heavy taxes, conscription, rents, military corvée, and so forth. If the czar only knew of the crimes his faithless agents were committing in his name, he would punish them and rectify matters. When petitions failed and oppression continued, it may simply have indicated that an impostor—a false czar—was on the throne. In such cases, the peasants who joined the banners of a rebel claiming to be the true czar would be demonstrating their loyalty to the monarchy.…\n>\n> In a form of symbolic jujitsu, an apparently conservative myth counselling passivity becomes a basis for defiance and rebellion…\n\nScott also wrote about how “much of the folk culture of the peasant ‘little tradition’ amounts to a legitimation, or even a \u003Cem>celebration\u003C/em>” of resistance:\n\n> In this and other ways (e.g. tales of bandits, tricksters, peasant heroes, religious myths, carnivalesque parodies of authorities) the peasant subculture helps to underwrite dissimulation, poaching, theft, tax evasion, evasion of conscription, and so on. While folk culture is not coordinational in any formal sense, it often achieves a “climate of opinion” which, in other more institutionalized societies, might require a public relations campaign.\n\n## American Constitutionalists\n\nThe place of the benevolent, fatherly Czar in American folklore is held by the U.S. Constitution.\nMany Americans believe that this document describes or foretells a good, honest, faithful, protective, restrained government.\nIn this mythology, the reason the present government does not match this description, although it claims the Constitution as the source of its authority, is because the present government is a fraud—a sort of impostor on the throne.\nSometimes this mythology hearkens for a never-yet-enacted sort of Platonic constitutional order; other times it pretends to find such an order in the misty past of the real history of the United States and believes that we were somehow expelled from this political Eden but can find our way back if we keep the faith.\n\nBased on many variations of this myth, a large and enduring subculture of “constitutionalist” tax protesters has developed.\nIts adherents subscribe to an increasingly baroque and ever-evolving mythology in which the entire federal income tax apparatus is operating outside of the \u003Cem>real\u003C/em> United States government.\nThey believe that you can best show your loyalty to the U.S. Constitution by treating the IRS as a hostile foreign cancer that impersonates healthy tissue in the body politic but has no real authority.\n\n## The Poll Tax Rebellion\n\n“Poll tax” came to be the most widely-accepted name for what Thatcher’s government had been hoping would go down as the benign-sounding “community charge.”\nThis naming was a potent propaganda coup for the resistance movement.\nDanny Burns, who chronicled that successful tax rebellion, says that “the story of [Wat Tyler’s] peasants revolt against the Poll Tax in 1381 was told in virtually every meeting.\nCalling on these traditions was an important part of explaining why non-cooperation was needed…”\nDuring the rebellion, people also hung signs in their windows reading “No Poll Tax Here”—these signs hearkened back to similar signs from the tax resistance accompanying the Reform Act agitation in the 1830s.\n\nNow, after the success of the anti-poll tax campaign, \u003Cem>it\u003C/em> has become the example that today’s campaigns emulate and try to live up to—for example, the later Household Tax resistance campaign in Ireland.\n\n\u003Chr

Vallabhbhai to one of these [Raniparaj] villages.… The young women, who had taken the Khadi pledge three years ago in the presence of Gandhiji and shed their trinkets and heavy brass ornaments, were all there in spotlessly white Khadi, brimming over with joy and lustily singing Satyagraha songs.\n>\n> The mention of the Satyagraha songs reminds me of one or two things that happened during the month.… Phulchandbhai had already some songs ready, and the atmosphere in the taluka gave him the inspiration for many more… The plain and homely songs spread the message of Satyagraha in a most effective manner, and men, women, and children had them on their lips. One cannot speak too highly of the part played in the movement by Phulchandbhai and his songs.…\n\n> We visited Nani Phalod, a small village, at about 9 p.m. There was a huge procession of men and women, the former singing Satyagraha songs, and the latter singing a song from an old saint of which the refrain was: “All our sorrows have ended, now that the Master has come.”…\n\n> There were huge meetings everywhere, attended by hundreds of women, laying heaps of [homespun] yarn before Sjt. Vallabhbhai, as in 1921, and lustily singing \u003Ci>bhajans\u003C/i>. The invincible spirit of the people evidenced everywhere was bound to exasperate the officials even more.…\n\n> The women of Varad… had their own songs, some of them being old songs of the saints and some composed by themselves to suit the fight in which they were engaged, and tacked on to the originals.\n\n## American Revolution\n\nThe boycotts and tax strikes of the American Revolution also had their songs.\nWhen patriots gathered to spin homespun yarn (see manufacture & sell alternatives to taxed goods), their work would be accompanied by “many stirring tunes, anthems, and liberty songs.”\nOne such tune tried to convince listeners that homespun cloth was more than just patriotic—it was a fashion must:\n\n> Of economy boast, let your pride be the most\u003Cbr />\n>  To show clothes of your own make and spinning.\u003Cbr />\n> What if homespun they say is not quite so gay\u003Cbr />\n>  As brocades, yet be not in a passion,\u003Cbr />\n> For when once it is known this is much worn in town,\u003Cbr />\n>  One and all will cry out—’Tis the fashion!\u003Cbr />\n> And, as one, all agree, that you’ll not married be\u003Cbr />\n>  To such as will wear London factory,\u003Cbr />\n> But at first sight refuse, tell ’em such you will choose\u003Cbr />\n>  As encourage our own manufactory.\u003Cbr />\n> No more ribbons wear, nor in rich silks appear;\u003Cbr />\n>  Love your country much better than fine things;\u003Cbr />\n> Begin without passion, ’twill soon be the fashion\u003Cbr />\n>  To grace your smooth locks with a twine string.\u003Cbr />\n> Throw aside your Bohea, and your Green Hyson tea,\u003Cbr />\n>  And all things with a new-fashion duty;\u003Cbr />\n> Procure a good store of the choice Labrador,\u003Cbr />\n>  For there’ll soon be enough here to suit you.\u003Cbr />\n> These do without fear, and to all you’ll appear,\u003Cbr />\n>  Fair, charming, true, lovely and clever;\u003Cbr />\n> Though the times remain darkish, young men may be sparkish,\u003Cbr />\n>  And love you much stronger than ever.\u003Cbr />\n> Then make yourselves easy, for no one will teaze ye,\u003Cbr />\n>  Nor tax you, if chancing to sneer\u003Cbr />\n> At the sense-ridden tools, who think us all fools;\u003Cbr />\n>  But they’ll find the reverse far and near.\n\n## Whiskey Rebellion\n\nWar tax resister Joan Baez was fond of including the Whiskey Rebellion celebration tune “Copper Kettle” in her concerts.\nThe second verse packages some useful information about how the tax authorities search for stills, and how moonshiners can evade the search:\n\n> Get you a copper kettle\u003Cbr />\n> Get you a copper coil\u003Cbr />\n> Cover with new made corn mash\u003Cbr />\n> And never more you’ll toil\n>\n> Build your fires of hickory\u003Cbr />\n> Hickory or ash or oak\u003Cbr />\n> Don’t use no green or rotten wood\u003Cbr />\n> They’ll catch you by the smoke\n>\n> My daddy he made whiskey\u003Cbr />\n> My granddaddy did too\u003Cbr />\n> We ain’t paid no whiskey tax\u003Cbr />\n> Since seventeen ninety-two!\n\n## American War Tax Resisters\n\nThe modern American war tax resistance movement has in recent years managed to collect its own funk anthem:\n\n> I was talking to a friend of mine,\u003Cbr />\n> Said he don’t want no wars no more.\u003Cbr />\n> They’re building bombs while our schools are falling.\u003Cbr />\n> Tell me what in the hell we’re paying taxes for.\u003Cbr />\n> What if we all stopped paying taxes?\u003Cbr />\n> Now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?\u003Cbr />\n> Stop paying taxes y’all.\n\n…and a folk song:\n\n> Don’t send your money to Washington\u003Cbr />\n> To fight a war that’s never done.\u003Cbr />\n> Don’t play their games don’t be their pawns\u003Cbr />\n> And don’t be afraid of the neo-cons.\n\n…and a rap:\n\n> You don’t give money to the bums\u003Cbr />\n> On the corner with a sign, bleeding from their gums.\u003Cbr />\n> Talking about you don’t support a crackhead—\u003Cbr />\n> What you think happens to the money from yo taxes?\u003Cbr />\n> Shit, the government’s an addict\u003Cbr />\n> With a billion dollar a week kill-brown-people habit\u003Cbr />\n> …\u003Cbr />\n> And the end of the year add up what they subtracted:\u003Cbr />\n> 3 outta twelve months your salary\u003Cbr />\n> Paid for that madness—man, that’s sadness\n\nWhen a youth activist group joined war tax resisters at a tax day demonstration at the Oakland federal building, they brought their lyrical skills along:\n\n> People, People, People, can’t you see?\u003Cbr />\n> They kill around the world with tax money.\u003Cbr />\n> Stealing from workers ’s how their money’s made,\u003Cbr />\n> I guess that’s why we’re broke and they’re so paid!\u003Cbr />\n> People, People, People, can’t you see?\u003Cbr />\n> They tax the poor more, the rich stay greedy.\u003Cbr />\n> No money for health or to educate,\u003Cbr />\n> I guess that’s why we’re broke and they’re so paid!\n\nThey combined these lyrics with a well-rehearsed pantomime to drive the point home.\n\nAt another American tax day protest, this one in St. Louis in 2003, war tax resisters at the federal building sang a protest song with lyrics like these:\n\n> For the cost of cluster bombs\u003Cbr />\n> that maim and leave to bleed\u003Cbr />\n> our kids could have more teachers\u003Cbr />\n> helping them to read.\n\nThese examples are for the most part lyrics of exhortation that are designed to convince wavering taxpayers that the time is ripe to stop paying (or to remind wavering resisters why their resistance is important). People will sometimes reflect seriously on an exhortation expressed lyrically when they would dismiss it if they had to sift through a reasoned argument first. Lyrics also have a way of getting stuck in the mind, echoing off the walls of the skull and returning to consciousness long after they are first heard.\n\n## Castine, Maine Resisters\n\nResidents in Castine, Maine, upset at their local taxes being siphoned off by state politicians, started a tax resistance campaign and accompanied it by protest songs.\n\nIn one, \u003Ci>I Just Found Out (Who the “They” Is)\u003C/i>, the lyricist reminds people that it is their acquiescence that allows government injustice to continue.\nHe explained: “I’ve heard so many people talk about what ‘they’ are doing.\nThis is my attempt to show that the ‘they’ are those who let government operate by default.”\n\n## Meo Rebellion\n\nWhen Meo farmers killed a tax collector during a tax strike aimed at the British-backed Maharaja in the 1930s, they commemorated the occasion with a song of defiant triumph:\n\n> Rebels in the open the Meos did then rejoice\u003Cbr />\n> They conferred among themselves and spoke in a single voice\u003Cbr />\n> Your \u003Ci>názim\u003C/i>’s dead and ever since\u003Cbr />\n>  we aren’t ruled by any prince\u003Cbr />\n> To London by now you should’ve fled,\u003Cbr />\n>  and do take along your dead.\n\n## Dray and Land Tax Resistance\n\nDuring the quickly successful Anti Dray and Land Tax League campaign in South Australia, “an eccentric gentleman” made a lyrical interpretation of the League’s manifesto and put it to music (and later made it available as sheet music with lyrics for a shilling a pop):\n\n> We’ve sever’d ourselves from our friends and home,\u003Cbr />\n>  And far over the ocean we’ve come, my boys!\u003Cbr />\n> To reap from our toil, on this sunny soil,\u003Cbr />\n>  A better reward than at home, my boys!\u003Cbr />\n>   But sorrow clouds Hope’s sunny face;\u003Cbr />\n>   Our autocratic rulers base\u003Cbr />\n>   Have taxed our roads, and taxed our drays\u003Cbr />\n>   And coward slave is he who pays.\n>\n>  Then down with the road and the dray-tax, too,\u003Cbr />\n>   And show to the minions of tyranny,\u003Cbr />\n>  Bold Britons are we, who dare to be free,\u003Cbr />\n>   And die for our rights and liberty.\n>\n> To direct taxation we’ll not submit,\u003Cbr />\n>  Without representation, I trow, my boys!\u003Cbr />\n> ’Tis base, and, what’s worse, ’tis the monster curse\u003Cbr />\n>  Of Turkey and Russia, e’en now, my boys!\u003Cbr />\n>   We’ll dare to brave oppression’s brand,\u003Cbr />\n>   Hurl despotism from the land;\u003Cbr />\n>   We’ll wear no chains of slavery—\u003Cbr />\n>   We will be free—we will be free!\u003Cbr />\n> Then down with the road and the dray-tax, too…\n>\n> Shall we to ourselves play the traitor knave?\u003Cbr />\n>  Shall we who for freedom came here, my boys!\u003Cbr />\n> Resign all our rights, like a dastard slave,\u003Cbr />\n>  And be ruled like a serf through fear, my boys?\u003Cbr />\n>   Our wives, and sons, and daughters see,\u003Cbr />\n>   Racked by the stings of poverty?\u003Cbr />\n>   Oh, no, by Heaven, as men we’ll die,\u003Cbr />\n>   Ere we to despot rule comply!\u003Cbr />\n> Then down with the road and the dray-tax, too…\n\n## Household Tax Resisters\n\nResistance to “household taxes” in Ireland was accompanied by song—with “The Resistance Choir” singing its song “Now Is the Time for Rage” at demonstrations, rallies, and other events.\nResistance Choir member Tina MacVeigh explained that “we have the Resistance Choir using the song in political flash-mobs around Dublin to counter the propaganda onslaught of Revenue, and then we have the production of the song from one of our live performances as a download single.\nWe are giving people opposed to the tax another way to vote against it.\nSo don’t sit around, let’s fight this tax, and we can beat it.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Desai, Mahadev \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i> (1929) pp. 74–75, 96,

Yourself as a Criminal for Having Paid Taxes","A counterintuitive tactic is for resisters to turn themselves in for prosecution for having paid taxes.",[],{"order":493,"hidden":39,"attrs":494},12,{},"A counterintuitive tactic that has been used in some tax resistance campaigns is for resisters to turn themselves in for prosecution for having \u003Cem>paid\u003C/em> taxes.\n\nFor example, a group of Welsh war tax resisters went to the police in 1996 and “confessed to the crime of paying income and VAT taxes used for British nuclear programs, in violation of international law” (the police declined the invitation to arrest them).\n\nThe legal reasoning, in the abstract, is not entirely far-fetched, but it is a sort of affected naïveté to expect the government’s law enforcement apparatus to respect it.\nThis sort of tactic is a form of symbolic protest and can help to educate people about their accountability for government activities that are conducted with their acquiescence and support.\n\n## The Nuremberg Principles\n\nIs there anything to the theory that a taxpayer becomes legally culpable for cooperating with the illegal acts of the government?\n\nSome people believe that the Nuremberg Principles make this a plausible argument.\nThe people who drafted those Principles were trying to articulate what they supposed to be international, ever-present, and self-evident crimes.\nThis was meant to solve the problems of jurisdiction and ex post facto law in the trials of Nazi war criminals, and was also meant to formally outlaw such things as aggressive war.\nThe Principles state, in part:\n\n> Complicity in the commission of a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity is a crime under international law.\n\nand also:\n\n> The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.\n\nA number of war tax resisters have taken these Principles as an inspiration, and some have even adopted the conceit of saying that they are afraid that if they pay taxes they may risk being prosecuted under the theory the Principles articulate.\n\nOne American war tax resister told me that when he refused to pay his taxes in 2003, “I also asked the IRS if they could provide legal assurance that paying taxes would not leave me open to prosecution under the Nuremberg Principles.\nThe IRS replied that they could not provide a quick response to my letter since they had received ‘a large number of similar requests.’”\n\n## Conspiracy Theory\n\nA blogger once told me:\n“If you pay taxes, you are as responsible for war as the soldier who kills people.\nIf you pay taxes, you are directly responsible for every bad thing government does.\nPaying taxes is immoral.” Gandhi had a similar thought:\n\n> Most people do not understand the complicated machinery of the government. They do not realize that every citizen silently but none the less certainly sustains the government of the day in ways of which he has no knowledge. Every citizen therefore renders himself responsible for every act of his government. And it is quite proper to support it so long as the actions of the government are bearable. But when they hurt him and his nation, it becomes his duty to withdraw his support.\n\nArguments like these bear some resemblance to the legal concept of “conspiracy.”\nOne set of jury instructions about criminal conspiracy put it this way:\n\n> [W]here several persons conspire or combine together to commit any unlawful act, each is criminally responsible for the acts of his associates or confederates committed in furtherance of any prosecution of the common design for which they combine. In contemplation of law, the act of one is the act of all. Each is responsible for everything done by his confederates, which follows incidentally in the execution of the common design as one of its probable and natural consequences, even though it was not intended as a part of the original design or common plan.\n\nTo prove “conspiracy” in the this sense, you have to show that the conspirators agreed to work together to achieve some common end, and that either the end itself, or the methods they chose to reach that end, were illegal.\nThis isn’t as hard to prove as it might sound at first.\nYou don’t necessarily have to prove that the conspirators actually met or signed onto a formal plan.\nAs another set of jury instructions put it:\n\n> It is not necessary, to constitute a conspiracy, that two or more persons should meet together, and enter into an explicit or formal agreement for an unlawful scheme, or that they should directly by words or in writing, state what the unlawful scheme is to be, and the details of the plan or means by which the unlawful combination is to be made effective. It is sufficient if two or more persons, in any manner or through any contrivance, positively or tacitly, come to a mutual understanding to accomplish a common and unlawful design.\n\nand another:\n\n> [A]ll who take part in a conspiracy after it is formed and while it is in execution, and all who, with the knowledge of the facts, concur in the facts originally formed and aid in executing them, are fellow conspirators. Their concurrence, without proof of an agreement to concur, is conclusive against them. They commit the offense when they become partners to the transaction or further the original plan.\n\nDo \u003Cem>taxpayers\u003C/em> meet this sort of qualification?\nIf you put on your prosecutor’s-hat, you might look at these instructions and think, “sure, I could make the charge stick.”\nBut if I’m defending a taxpayer against a charge of conspiracy, I’ve got a good trump card to play:\nIf my client is accused of conspiring with a government by paying taxes to it—how can you suggest that there was some sort of “agreement” or “mutual understanding” if the government had to threaten my client with penalties for noncompliance?\nThat doesn’t sound like an agreement to me: my client isn’t an accomplice, but a victim!\n\n## Duress—How Much Can it Excuse?\n\nBut just how good of a defense is it to say that you were paying taxes under duress?\nCan such an argument always relieve you of all responsibility, or does it only work when certain conditions are met, or only relieve you of a certain amount of responsibility?\nHow much compulsion must the government use before it absorbs responsibility?\nIs there a threshold?\nDoes it depend on what they’re trying to absorb responsibility for?\n\nAfter all, it couldn’t be the case (\u003Cem>could it?\u003C/em>) that a government could “force” you to murder someone by threatening you with a small fine for refusing—and that the government could take all of the guilt off your shoulders in this way if you decided to comply.\n\nAlas, when people have debated the ethics of tax paying and of tax resistance, they have tended to regard government compulsion as an all-or-nothing sort of thing, and so questions like these are left unaddressed.\n\nAmerican abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison said at one point that it was wrong to willingly pay taxes to a government that upholds slavery, but that to excuse yourself it is sufficient for you to announce that you are not paying willingly, and to strike an attitude that is in accord with that declaration:\n\n> [A person] may consent peaceably to yield up what is demanded of him, but not without remonstrance, and only as he would give up his purse to a highwayman. He will not recognize it as a lawful tax—he will not pay it as a tax—but will denounce it as robbery and oppression.\n\nThe proper thing to do when the tax collector comes calling, in this school of thought, is to refuse to pay voluntarily but to submit peacefully to distraint of property.\nBut one critic argued that such passive tax resistance is really just pointless, passive-aggressive behavior (something like the “petulant mode” of protest I warned about—see [Petulant Protest](../../multiplefronts/petulantprotest/)):\n\n> It may well be questioned if the payment of rates or taxes is voluntary at all, since the account is presented in the form of a demand, and not a polite request. Inasmuch as payment is compulsory in any case, is not Passive Resistance merely an awkward, expensive, and an inconvenient mode of payment for all concerned?\n\nIt’s easy to confuse these two cases:\n\n1. Someone actually forces you to do something (such as forcing you to stay in prison by locking the doors).\n1. Someone threatens you with unpleasant consequences if you do not do something.\n\nIn the first case, you don’t have alternatives to choose from, so you don’t have any blame for what you’re stuck with.\nIn the second, though, it is merely the case that the characteristics of your options have been changed.\nYou still have a choice to make, and that choice can be praiseworthy or blameworthy.\nHannah Arendt, who studied the distressing ease with which the engineers of the Holocaust obtained the cooperation of their collaborators, warned against the idea “that to be tempted and to be forced are almost the same.”\nShe was fond of quoting Mary McCarthy on this question:\n\n> “If somebody points a gun at you and says, ‘Kill your friend or I will kill you,’ he is \u003Cem>tempting\u003C/em> you, that is all.”\n\nIf the tax collector says “give me your money or else,” that isn’t the end of the inquiry, but the time to ask “or else what?” and then to weigh the options.\nIf I believed the blogger’s argument that what the tax collector was saying was “be directly responsible for \u003Cem>every\u003C/em> bad thing government does or else” I’d be asking “or else \u003Cem>what?\u003C/em>” with bluff-calling incredulity.\n\n## When You Eat a Chiquita\n\nCan you be found legally guilty for payments you made under duress?\nYou certainly can, under some circumstances anyway.\nLook at what happened to Chiquita (the banana company).\n\nChiquita had been operating in Colombia and, as a cost of doing business there, had to pay taxes to some of the governments that controlled parts of the country.\nThree of those governments were designated terrorist organizations by the U.S. government, which prohibits anyone from providing funding to such organizations.\nThere is also an international agreement that prohibits funding terrorist organizations.\nIt says:\n\n> Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and wilfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out:\n>\n> (a) An act which constitutes an offence within the scope of and as defined in one of the treaties listed in the annex; or\n>\n> (b) Any other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.\n\nChiquita pled guilty in a plea bargain and was hit with a $25 million fine.\n\n## It’s Caesar’s Fault\n\nJ.G. James, the critic of “Passive Resistance” whom I quoted earlier, was an orthodox believer in law and government, and so he felt that when taxes or tax expenditures conflicted with conscience, the proper response was to do what could be done within the law to rectify the problem, but to go no further:\n\n> [I]t is the duty of a conscientious citizen to pay an unjust charge if he has tried in vain to prevent the measure passing into law, on the ground that he is no longer responsible for the expenditure of public funds after he has done his utmost to control that expenditure by legalized means.\n\nThis argument—that once the money is out of your hands you are no longer responsible for how it is spent—has come up frequently in debates about tax resistance, often even from tax resisters themselves when they try to explain the limits of their resistance.\n\nFor instance, G.W. Gillespe was a conscientious objector during the American Civil War who refused either to enlist or to hire a substitute to serve in his place.\nBut he said he would have been willing to pay a “militia exemption tax” to get out of service if he could afford it.\nHe explained:\n\n> [T]he idea of hiring a man to kill for me would implicate me in the crime; so I refused to give even five cents for a substitute.\n>\n> If I had had three hundred dollars, I could conscientiously have given it to Caesar as a last resort, to get exempt from the bloody field of carnal strife. Some tried to persuade me that it was just as bad to pay the money as to hire a substitute, as the money was for that purpose. The difference is great. The Lord will not hold me accountable for the mischief that money, taken from me by force, would do when employed by others. Caesar demands taxes of us; we pay them, according to the instruction and example of our Lord. We render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s, and Caesar hires a man to shoot his enemies for him; are we to blame? By no means. But to hire a man to fight in my place would be like hiring a thief to steal in my place: Both guilty.\n\n## Rendering unto caesar\n\nHere we hit one of the big stumbling blocks that Christian tax resisters have run into.\nThe New Testament is distressingly explicit, in \u003Ci>Romans\u003C/i> 13:\n\n> Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.… [I]t is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing. Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.\n\nIf Jesus wanted us to know that we should resist taxes to governments that would apply the tax money in sinful ways, he was given every opportunity to make this clear when he was asked:\n“Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”\nInstead, he responded with “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s,” which successfully bewildered everybody at the time, and the meaning of which continues to defy consensus today.\n\nThe best that Christian tax resisters could come up with, Biblically, to justify their position was either a confidently asserted, if somewhat strained reading of the “Give to Caesar” koan, or the story from \u003Ci>Acts\u003C/i> 5 in which the apostles defied the law and continued to preach the gospel according to God’s explicit command.\nAsked to explain themselves on that occasion,\n\n> Peter and the other apostles replied: “We must obey God rather than men!”\n\nMost Christian tax resisters took the “Give to Caesar” passage and certainly the one in Romans to mean that God does indeed command us to pay taxes, even to unjust governments, but they interpreted the Acts “obey God rather than men” statement as providing an occasional override—essentially: “render unto Caesar and submit to the government, unless that would mean disobeying God.”\n\nAmerican Christian pacifist T.S. Grimké put it this way:\n\n> [If the ruler] require me to pay taxes, although one object of the taxes be the support of idolatry, or the waging of war, I comply, simply because he has a clear right to levy taxes, and the responsibility of applying them is with him, not with me…\n>\n> If he commands what is unlawful, as a means for the attainment of even a lawful end, I refuse obedience. But if he commands what is lawful, intending when the command has been performed by me, to employ the fruit of my obedience in the accomplishment of unlawful purposes in which I have no hand, I obey, because he requires of me only what is rightful. I have nothing to do with his motive or his object.\n>\n> I would illustrate this by the case of a debt. I am indebted to another. He demands payment. I am not at liberty to refuse, because I happen to know, or have reason to believe that he will employ the money, when paid, for unlawful or immoral purposes. This follows from the principle already stated. My duty is very clear, to pay the debt: the use of the money, when paid, is at once his right and responsibility…\n>\n> [However, if the] magistrate, instead of a general tax law divides the taxes, and lays on the advocates of Peace the war tax. They cannot conscientiously pay it; because they are thus made the sole and direct instrument of carrying on the war, and without their compliance, it must be at a stand.\n\n## Is Paying a Tax Really Like Paying a Debt?\n\nThe comparison of taxes to debts has been an important metaphor in debates about the ethics of tax resistance.\n\nIf paying taxes to the government is good in and of itself (for instance, because God has so decreed it) then taxpaying can’t simply be judged according to its consequences.\nA tax payment, in this way of thinking, is not a donation or a subscription or a contribution that is made voluntarily with an aim to supporting whatever cause the funds are being raised for, but is a duty akin to paying a debt.\nYou can’t ethically refuse to repay a loan because you think the person you owe money to will spend the money unwisely.\n\nHere’s an example of how this metaphor was used to justify the nuanced position of one tax resister:\nJoshua Maule was a Quaker advocate of war tax resistance.\nWhen the government increased a general tax by a certain percentage in order to pay for war expenses (and explicitly said this was the reason), Maule refused to pay this additional fraction of his taxes, and he insisted that this was the only position consistent with traditional Quaker teaching regarding war and war taxes.\n\nMaule’s critics asked him why he continued to pay other taxes (for instance excise fees) or the remaining portion of his general tax—since surely some of \u003Cem>those\u003C/em> taxes would also go to pay for war.\nOne critic compared Maule to someone trying to avoid getting drunk by finding out what percentage of alcohol was in the booze, and then leaving that percentage of each of his drinks unfinished in the glass.\n\nMaule responded by trying to draw a sharp line between ordinary civil taxes, which, like a debt, he must pay regardless of how some of it may be used, and \u003Cem>explicit\u003C/em> war taxes, which fall under a different rule:\n\n> I am not accountable for the acts of other men: if I owe a just debt, I must pay it; if the person receiving the money uses it for a bad purpose, the accountability is with him; but if he demand money of me avowedly to be used in any way to the plundering of my neighbor, destroying his property, or taking his life, then if I furnish money thus demanded I become an accomplice in the evil work and accountable for the sin.\n\nQuaker Samuel Allinson put forward a forceful attack on the tax-as-debt analogy in 1780.\nFirst, he denied outright that God has commanded us to give Caesar anything that Caesar plans to put to a sinful purpose:\n\n> [I]f tribute is demanded for a use that is anti-christian, it seems right for every Christian to deny it, for Caesar can have no title to that which opposes the Lord’s command.\n\nHe then attacked the idea that taxation represents some sort of secularly-contracted debt, or part of an implicit “social contract.”\nAllinson argued that no Christian would agree to the terms of a contract that might require him to do the devil’s work:\n\n> Every valid contract is voluntarily entered into, and as it is the duty of every one previously to see that his engagement is innocent, so when his promise is purchased by a consideration given it would be dishonest and deceitful not to perform it, the other party having, as it were, deposited so much effects in his hands which he is to render back according to agreement, and when received the receiver has a right to apply it as he pleases without any account to the payer. But in the case of taxes he who gives has a right to call to such an account, and therefore seems himself liable for and privy to the application. Every man has or has not given his assent to the government he lives under, in the first, he has formally declared his allegiance thereto, in the latter, that allegiance is implied in consideration of his receiving the protection and benefit of it in the safety of his person and the security of his property, in both, it is no more than to be “true and faithful” which can never mean a compliance with every requisition, for we owe a superior allegiance to the King of Kings, and whenever the requisitions of man run counter thereto we “ought to obey God rather than men”… We have never entered into any contract, express or implied, for the payment of taxes for war, nor the performance of anything contrary to our religious duties…\n\n## Conclusion?\n\nSo have we made any progress here?\nWe’ve at least been able to review the question of taxpayer complicity from several angles and to get some historical perspective on how people have wrestled with it.\nI think I’ve demonstrated that of the two extreme positions—that paying taxes makes you a fully-guilty accomplice in whatever the government does, or that because paying taxes is a lawful demand it is therefore a decision without personal ethical import—neither can be accepted uncritically.\n\nI’ve concentrated here on the Christian and the legal viewpoints, but to me, as a nonbeliever (on both counts), those viewpoints are often only advisory at best and mere curiosities at worst. For me the question is an ethical one that has to be resolved with my reason and my conscience, and not by consulting the Bible or the law.\n\nAs best as I can figure, I am under no original ethical obligation to pay a tax.\nTaxpaying is not itself unquestionably good, and I did not actually enter into something akin to an agreement or contract that I would be unethically violating by failing to pay.\nGiven that, I have to evaluate my decision to pay or not to pay a tax by imagining two worlds—one in which I paid the tax and one in which I didn’t—and choosing from them which one I’d prefer.\nBy doing this, I also imagine two of me—one who paid the tax and one who didn’t—and I choose which one I want to become.\n\nIn making this decision, some of my considerations will be more grandly ethical (which of these worlds is more just? which of the possible me am I more proud of?) and some will be more mundanely self-interested (in which world am I more satisfied or better-off or esteemed?).\nI will weigh these baskets of considerations and then make the wisest choice of which I am capable.\nThis seems to me to be the way people make decisions once they acknowledge the decisions are theirs to make, and that’s okay by me.\n\nWhere this has led me so far is to tax resistance.\nResisting some taxes completely (the federal income tax), others not so completely (federal excise taxes), others hardly at all (the state sales tax), others dysfunctionally (the self-employment tax, which I don’t pay voluntarily, but which I expect may be seized from me eventually).\nAlong the way, I recalculate my situation and recalibrate my decisions based on my best judgment and my evolving understanding.\nAnd in this I find it helpful to consider the thoughts of people who have grappled with these conundrums before me.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Note that Chiquita was not charged with conspiring with these Colombian terrorist groups—wasn’t charged as a co-conspirator or accessory in their crimes—but was charged with a distinct crime of providing funds to terrorist organizations.

But in the case of taxes he who gives has a right to call to such an account, and therefore seems himself liable for and privy to the application. Every man has or has not given his assent to the government he lives under, in the first, he has formally declared his allegiance thereto, in the latter, that allegiance is implied in consideration of his receiving the protection and benefit of it in the safety of his person and the security of his property, in both, it is no more than to be “true and faithful” which can never mean a compliance with every requisition, for we owe a superior allegiance to the King of Kings, and whenever the requisitions of man run counter thereto we “ought to obey God rather than men”… We have never entered into any contract, express or implied, for the payment of taxes for war, nor the performance of anything contrary to our religious duties…\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>So have we made any progress here?\nWe’ve at least been able to review the question of taxpayer complicity from several angles and to get some historical perspective on how people have wrestled with it.\nI think I’ve demonstrated that of the two extreme positions—that paying taxes makes you a fully-guilty accomplice in whatever the government does, or that because paying taxes is a lawful demand it is therefore a decision without personal ethical import—neither can be accepted uncritically.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve concentrated here on the Christian and the legal viewpoints, but to me, as a nonbeliever (on both counts), those viewpoints are often only advisory at best and mere curiosities at worst.

You are all well advanced in age and have seen the world; many of you are delegates and have discharged responsibilities in a greater or lesser measure. No one present, therefore, can ever hope to excuse himself by saying that he did not know what he was about when he took the oath.\n>\n> I know that pledges and vows are, and should be, taken on rare occasions. A man who takes a vow every now and then is sure to stumble. But if I can imagine a crisis in the history of the Indian community of South Africa when it would be in the fitness of things to take pledges, that crisis is surely now.…\n>\n> Resolutions of this nature cannot be passed by a majority vote. Only those who take a pledge can be bound by it. This pledge must not be taken with a view to produce an effect on outsiders. No one should trouble to consider what impression it might have upon the local Government, the Imperial Government, or the Government of India. Every one must only search his own heart, and if the inner voice assures him that he has the requisite strength to carry him through, then only should he pledge himself and then only would his pledge bear fruit.\n\nHis entire speech, which reflects on vows and the responsibility of vow makers, is worth reading in this context.\n\n## Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nPublic pledges can test the determination and strength of the movement—that is, if the pledges really are commitments and not just gestures.\nDuring the preparations for the Bardoli tax strike, the movement collected signed pledges from various regions as a way of feeling out which areas were most committed and which needed more prodding:\n\n> The people… commenced taking signatures to a tentative pledge for non-payment of assessment. The deliberative meeting this time was very largely attended, more villages having sent their representatives and quite a number of them having sent the pledges duly signed. There was quiet deliberation and dogged determination in their voices, as each stood up to render an account of what his village had done. Their word would have been nothing worth, if they had all mechanically stood up and repeated parrot-like the cry of non-payment. Each told his tale in his own way. “58 men have given their signatures in our village, 12 have not yet. But that does not matter,” said one. “All excepting the village headman have signed the pledge,” said another, “but the headman is not hostile to us.” “Our Patel has already paid up and a Vania from a neighbouring village also, but we never counted on them,” said a third one. “There is a section among us which is recalcitrant, but we believe as though they were not of us. Our section will never pay, come what may, and trust the rest to the will of God,” said a fourth one. Quite a large majority said: “All have given their signatures. There is no fear of anyone flinching.”\n\nAccording to Mahadev Desai, during the strike “[t]he bond of unity between the cultivating peasants themselves was the Satyagraha pledge.\nThe first month was entirely devoted to taking signatures on the pledge, and the reports from different camps gave minute details about every village:\nthe number of covenanters, shirkers, and whimperers, and the Sardar [commander] had to fix his programme according to the information received each day.”\n\nPeople on the front lines of a resistance movement can also use pledges to communicate to the movement leadership or to each other that their commitment remains strong.\nFor instance, a woman was paying respects to the Bardoli tax strike commander, Vallabhbhai Patel, and handed him a small donation and a note that read:\n\n> We are doing nothing out of the ordinary. This is a fight for our own interest, and for our hearths and homes. I am grateful to you for having taken the Satyagraha pledge from my husband, and I am here to give an additional pledge, that both of us shall willingly put up with whatever suffering that comes to our lot, in the shape of forfeiture of property moveable and immovable. I also promise that should my husband be privileged to be sent to jail, I shall cheerfully bid him godspeed.\n\n## French Liberals\n\nIn 1829 several French newspapers printed the text of a pledge in which French liberals vowed to resist any taxes that the monarchy might try to institute without going through constitutional channels.\nThese newspapers were prosecuted by the crown for printing such a seditious thing, but in court they pointed out that the King himself, along with three other members of the nobility, had once signed a tax resistance pledge to protest against republican infringements on their privileges.\n\n## A Vote in Castine\n\nIn Castine, Maine, in 1975, the “pledge” took the form of a vote:\nat a specially-convened town meeting, the town voted 125 to 65 to refuse to collect a school funding tax—in defiance of a superior court order telling them that they must do so.\n\n## Reform Act Vow\n\nThe Reform Act agitation really hit its stride in 1831 when a huge rally—150,000 people strong—vowed with a roar to stop paying taxes until the Act’s passage.\nOne account of the occasion read:\n\n> He declared before God, that, if all constitutional modes of obtaining the success of the reform measure failed, he should and would be the first man to refuse the payment of taxes, except by a levy upon his goods [tremendous cheering, which lasted some minutes]. I now call upon all who hear me, and who are prepared to join me in this step, to hold up your hands [an immense forest of hands was immediately elevated, accompanied by vehement cheering]. I now call upon you who are not prepared to adopt this course, to hold up your hands and signify your dissent [not a single hand appearing, loud shouts and cheers were repeated].\n\n## “New Rush”\n\nIn South Africa’s “New Rush” in 1874, a number of miners signed a pledge that read, in part, “I promise on my honour and in presence of the people that I shall not from this day forward—until released from this obligation by the officers of the League—pay any taxes or impositions whatsoever… for the support and maintenance of the Government of this territory; and that I shall buy from, sell to, or deal with only such men as have also taken this pledge or obligation; and that I shall to the utmost of my power, with purse and person, protect any and every officer and member of the League against coercion or consequences of what nature soever arising out of the action necessitated by this pledge.”\n\n## American War Tax Resisters\n\n![](../../../assets/writers-and-editors.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>the writers and editors war tax protest of 1967\u003C/figcaption>\n\nThis tactic has been popular in the American war tax resistance movement.\n\nIn 1967, for example, more than five hundred writers and editors added their names to a war tax resistance pledge that appeared as a newspaper advertisement.\nThe names included those of such well-known figures as James Baldwin, Noam Chomsky, Philip K. Dick, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Betty Friedan, Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, Henry Miller, Grace Paley, Thomas Pynchon, Susan Sontag, Benjamin Spock, Gloria Steinem, William Styron, Hunter S.

If it is allowed that there is a meaning in people wearing primroses on Primrose Day, surely there is much more in a people using a particular kind of cloth and giving a particular type of labour to the cause they hold dear. From their compliance with the \u003Ci>khādī\u003C/i> test I shall infer that they have shed untouchability, and that they have nothing but brotherly feeling towards all without distinction of race, colour, or creed. Those who will do this are as much Satyagrahis as those who will be singled out for civil disobedience.\n\nGandhi himself put in many hours at the spinning wheel, and demanded this of his followers as well.\n\n“Gandhi caps” made from \u003Ci>khādī\u003C/i> became almost a uniform of the resistance.\nOne news dispatch from around the time of the Dharasana salt raid noted:\n\n> …the growth of the Gandhi movement was shown by the increased number of persons wearing the Gandhi caps. In the cities… a majority of the people wear them; they also are beginning to be worn in villages in Punjab while even in aristocratic Simla one person in six of the population in the bazaars have donned caps, which is the symbol of the nationalist campaign.\n\n## American Revolution\n\nGandhi’s campaign wasn’t the first blow against the British Empire that was struck in part by homespun cloth and by the conspicuous consumption of locally-manufactured goods.\nThese were also important parts of the American Revolution.\n\nHere is an example reported in a 1770 edition of the \u003Ci>Massachusetts Gazette\u003C/i>:\n\n> On Wednesday evening the honorable speaker and gentlemen of the House of Burgesses gave a ball at the capitol… and it is with the greatest pleasure we inform our readers… [of] the patriotic spirit… manifested in the dress of the ladies on that occasion, who, to the number of near one hundred, appeared in homespun gowns; a lively and striking instance of their acquiescence and concurrence in whatever may be the true and essential interest of their country.\n\nPatriotic Americans worked together at festive “spinning bees” to card, spin, weave, and sew—ways that everybody could demonstrate their revolutionary spirit and participate in the resistance.\n\n## Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca Riots in Wales in the mid-19th century were notorious for the distinctive garb donned by the parties of resisters who would gather to tear down tollgates.\n\nThe leader of each party was usually a man dressed up in women’s clothing and a large bonnet, who sometimes also wore a long horse-hair wig or carried a parasol, and who was given the name “Rebecca.”\nRebecca’s followers, or “daughters,” also were men wearing women’s clothes, or at least white blouses over their clothes, and sometimes bonnets or other high-crowned hats, occasionally with fern fronds, feathers, or other decorations on them.\nThey would paint their faces black or yellow, and sometimes drape their horses in white sheets.\n\nIn this case, the point of the costuming was not so much to express public pride as for other purposes. Such as:\n\n* to disguise the participants so that the government would be less able to take reprisals against them\n* to resonate with ancient folk forms of grassroots vigilantism and protest that had a similar character (see [Resonate with Myths, Legends, Folklore, or Historical Examples](../resonatewithlegends/))\n* to intimidate toll gate keepers with their strangeness and their reputation\n* to create a fluid figurehead for the movement that could be adopted and then set aside by various people, so as to make the movement less vulnerable to reprisals against its leadership\n* to make the resistance more festive and carnivalesque and thereby encourage participation\n* to make it easier to identify fellow-resisters in the confusion of late-night raids on dark country roads\n\n## Relics of the Glastonbury Cows\n\nAbby & Julia Smith refused to pay taxes to a local government that denied women the vote (and that took advantage of this by excessively taxing women’s property in order to ease the tax burden on male voters and to redistribute the money to male patronage recipients).\nIn response, the government periodically seized and auctioned off the Smith sisters’ cows (whom they had named “Votey” and “Taxey”).\n\nEmblems made from hairs of the cows’ tails, woven into the shape of flowers, and tied with ribbons emblazoned with the slogan “Taxation Without Representation,” became popular adornments for supporters of the Smiths’ tax resistance.\n\n## War Tax Resisters\n\nIn 2007, I spoke at a “Stop Funding the War in Iraq” rally near the offices of a U.S. Congressional leader.\nThe rally was being put on by anti-war groups that were eager to convince Congress to stop funding the war, but that hadn’t necessarily put much thought into the idea that their own members could cut off \u003Cem>their\u003C/em> funding by resisting taxes.\n\nBut a local war tax resistance group was there, handing out stickers for people to wear that read “I refuse to fund this war!”\nJust about everybody who was offered a sticker was eager to wear one, agreeing with the sentiment at least—one that harmonized with the theme of the day, but that pointedly made it more personal.\nPerhaps a few protesters then looked around and wondered: “Has everyone else here started resisting \u003Cem>their\u003C/em> taxes? Maybe it’s time for me to start.”\n\n## Fries Rebellion\n\nThe Fries Rebellion in the United States took place about a decade after the United States Constitution came into force, and soon after the success of the French Revolution.\nThe U.S. government at the time was under the presidency of John Adams, who, despite his revolutionary credentials, represented the more authoritarian, aristocratic, pro-English political faction.\nThe faction that was out of power was more populist, democratic, and pro-French.\n\nTax resisters who participated in the Fries Rebellion sometimes wore French tricolor cockades in their hats to demonstrate their affinity with the democratic revolutionaries across the pond, or wore their old American revolutionary militia uniforms to show their belief that the current rebellion was more in harmony with the spirit of the American Revolution than were the policies of the Adams administration.\n\n## Addiopizzo Movement\n\nBusinesses that pledge to refuse to pay the \u003Ci>pizzo\u003C/i> tax to the Sicilian mafia put “Addiopizzo” signs in their windows.\nThis signals that they are unafraid of mafia reprisals, and also helps those consumers who have joined the movement’s “Critical Consumption” buycott to know where they can shop \u003Ci>pizz\u003C/i>o-free.\n\nThough it might seem that such signs would invite trouble from a mafia that notoriously relies on credible threats to keep its coffers full, the Addiopizzo movement has held so firm that mafia enforcers have been caught on police wiretaps warning each other to \u003Cem>avoid\u003C/em> harassing Addiopizzo-marked businesses because the likelihood of payout is so low that the risks associated with extortion aren’t worth it.\n\n## Australian Miners\n\nIn 1854, Australian miners who were resisting a license tax held a “monster meeting” at which they passed a number of resolutions, including these:\n\n> [A]s it is necessary that the diggers should know their friends, every miner agrees to wear as a pledge of good faith, and in support of the cause, a piece of red ribbon on his hat, not to be removed until the license tax is abolished.\n>\n> That this meeting… desire to publicly express their esteem for the memory of the brave men who have fallen in battle [during “the late out-break”], and that to shew their respect every digger and their friends do wear tomorrow (Sunday) a band of black crape on his hat…\n\n## Other Ways to Show Pride\n\nMany of these have been examples of resisters showing pride in their resistance.\nThis can short-circuit the traditional government gambit of publishing the names of tax evaders as a way of shaming them as bankrupts or deadbeats.\nIf the government tries to shame tax resisters in this way, but the resisters have already eagerly made their resistance public, this gambit loses its power.\n\nWhen local governments in the U.K. tried this against poll tax resisters in the Thatcher years, the newspapers who published the lists of “shame” got letters from resisters who were outraged that they had not made the list—and who insisted that their names be included too!\n\nThe Women’s Freedom League was a British women’s suffrage activist group that refused to pay taxes on the salaries of its employees.\nWhen it was threatened with a legal writ by the government, it decided to auction the writ in a fundraiser as though it were a treasured award.\n\nGreek tax resisters in Penteli (near Athens) refused to pay new taxes the government had added to their utility bills.\nTo express their communal pride in resistance they hung their urgent “past due” notices from a Christmas tree in the town square as ornaments.\n\nWhen the IRS levied war tax resister Thad Crouch’s salary, he remembers:\n\n> How fortunate to be levied a week before tax day. What a great media hook!…not only would I publicly refuse to pay my taxes, I would throw a party to rejoice in my religious persecution and \u003Cem>I would invite the IRS!\u003C/em>…\n>\n> About forty people ranging from six months to 70 years old enjoyed that fun-filled night as we sang, beat drums, recited poems, and laughed beneath the “peace tax cranes.” A friend and I made origami peace cranes from tax returns and strung them from the ceiling. Midway through the party I took just a few minutes to thank everyone for coming. I explained my WTR [war tax resistance], the Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund, and why I was rejoicing in a levy.\n>\n> …The most popular question was “Did you really invite the IRS?” We were happy not only to answer yes, but also to entertain guests with the voice mail message of an Austin IRS agent thanking me for the invitation but declining on behalf of their office. Guests howled with laughter that I hope dispelled their fears as it had done mine the week before.\n>\n> …So the next time the collection agent comes knocking and you find yourself faced with tough decisions, stress and fear, take time to rejoice. Laugh, throw a party, educate others, and dispel fear!\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Gandhi, M.K. “Civil Disobedience” \u003Ci>Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)\u003C/i> (1961) pp. 306–07\n* “Britain Facing Heavy Loss in No-Tax Drive” (Associated Press) \u003Ci>Binghamton Press\u003C/i> 2 June 1930, p. 21\n* \u003Ci>Massachusetts Gazette\u003C/i> 12 February 1770, as found in Frothingham, Richard \u003Ci>The Rise of the Republic of the United States\u003C/i>, 5th ed.

Locals cut off the station’s electricity and water supplies.\n\n## Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nThere were battles between police and protesters during the poll tax rebellion in the Thatcher years.\n\nIn Bristol, the crowd charged the police and rescued demonstrators who had been arrested.\n“One police officer was kicked unconscious when he tried to make an arrest.\nSix more were dragged out of their van.”\n\nIn London, “As the police baton-charged the crowd… they were resisted by a hail of bricks, bottles, and stones.”\n\nPolice brutality turned a demonstration into a riot in Trafalgar Square.\n“Mounted riot police baton-charged the crowd.\nThe crowd, angered by this violent provocation, retaliated by throwing sticks, banner poles, bottles—anything they could find.\nYoung people, armed only with placards, fought hand to hand with police.…\nAs the missiles began to rain down the police retreated:”\n\n> …Pedestrian isles were being torn up and real serious lumps of concrete being thrown at the romper-suited police. I found myself with rock in hand. The first I threw was aimed at a group of police. I watched it bounce off a shield. My second rock was more specifically aimed at their front line. Again, it was well-deflected. I saw a rock strike a policeman’s visor and he didn’t even blink. The police were shielding themselves from the missiles raining down, but they were vulnerable to rocks aimed at their legs and midriffs. The police were taking a battering. Every now and then a policeman would crumple to his knees and the crowd would roar.\n\nMore than 100 police officers would be treated for injuries sustained during the riot.\nA spokesman for the police said, “I have never seen such sustained and savage violence used directly against the police.”\n\n## Vyborg Manifesto\n\n![](../../../assets/vyborg.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>the Russian duma-in-exile arrives in Vyborg, Finland\u003C/figcaption>\n\nAfter the Russian duma-in-exile issued a tax resistance manifesto, the government said that if people refused to pay taxes, it would send in troops who would show no mercy.\n“Without waiting for soldiers to put the threat of the government into execution, the peasants have inaugurated a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the troops already in the province.…\nWithin the last few days a number of military sentinels have been shot down in ambush or attacked by the peasants.”\n\n## Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca Rioters in Wales targeted constables who tried to stop or investigate the riots or to conduct tax seizures.\n\nIn one case, two or three hundred Rebeccaites met at a Pontyberem village, and while there “made some special constables promise not to serve, and took away their staves.”\nHere are some other examples:\n\n> They then attacked the house of the blacksmith, who had previously said he would face fifteen of the best Rebecca boys, and who also had been sworn in as a special constable; according to his own statements he was a man devoid of fear. The smith—fearless man of Vulcan—had, however, departed; but smash! went in his door and windows, and his deserted smithy was practically destroyed.…\n>\n> At the outset of these proceedings the toll-man “Dick” contrived, by running over ditch and dell, to warn a parish constable, one Evan Thomas, otherwise “The Porthyrhyd Lion,” of his own mishap, as well as the peril to which he thought him exposed, Evan being somewhat unpopular in the neighbourhood. On receiving this hint, away bolted “Ianto,” scampering over the ditches and fields until he found a cow-house where he lay concealed in anxious suspense the remainder of the night. Notwithstanding the retreat of “Ianto,” about seventy of the tribe visited his domicile, smashed in his windows and doors, destroyed his shelf and dresser, and all his crockery, as well as the spokes of a new cart, put a cheese on the fire, cut down some of the trees in the garden, and then simultaneously raised the cry, “Alas! poor Ianto!”… Evan the constable… if found, was to have his ears cut off.…\n>\n> These riotous proceedings caused considerable excitement and alarm… The different persons in the neighbourhood who were sworn in as special constables… gave up their staves, with the determination of refusing on any future occasions to interfere with the movements of Rebecca or the protection of the toll-house.\n\n> John Evans and John Lewis, two Sheriff’s officers from Carmarthen, were sent… to make a distress on the goods and chattels of William Philipp… They were attacked by about twenty-five of the ’Beccas, and beaten in a dreadful manner.… John Evans was compelled to go on his knees before them, and put the distresses and authority to distrain in the fire. He was then made to take his oath on the Bible, which one of them put in his hands, that he would never again enter the premises to make another distress. He was compelled to make use of the following words: “As the Lord liveth, and my soul liveth, I will never come here to make any distress again.” After taking the oath, he was set free, and the two bailiffs returned to town.\n\n> William Chambers, who led a police unit that wounded and arrested some Rebeccaites, was targeted multiple times. On one occasion, a stack of his corn was burned, on another, a stack of straw met the torch. Later his farm and outbuildings were all engulfed in flames. A horse of his that had been rescued from another of his farms as it burned down was later shot.\n\n## Tithe War\n\nDuring the Tithe War in Ireland, British troops killed 18 resisters who were trying to reclaim seized livestock.\nIn return, the resisters killed 18 troops in an ambush:\n\n> A number of writs against defaulters were issued by the Court of Exchequer, and intrusted to the care of process-servers, who, guarded by a strong force, proceeded on their mission with secrecy and despatch. Bonfires along the surrounding hills, however, and shrill whistles through the dell, soon convinced them that the people were not unprepared for hostile visitors. But the yeomanry pushed boldly on: their bayonets were sharp, their ball-cartridge inexhaustible, their hearts dauntless.

Police said three Jews, one dressed as an Arab, pushed a bomb-laden, Arab-type delivery cart into the building and fled, after clubbing a Jewish policeman and snatching a rifle from an Arab guard. Police tried to drag the cart from the building, but the rope parted. They said they then detonated the bomb with rifle fire, but “miscalculated the charge.”\n\nThe explosion destroyed the building, killed a constable, and injured five other officials.\n\n## Railroad Bond Shenanigans\n\nIn St. Claire county, Missouri, in 1877, “a gang of armed men rode into the county seat of Osceola and held tax officials at gunpoint while its members stole all the official tax records.…\nThe gang destroyed the tax records, and that meant that the county had no way of taxing anyone.”\nA year and a half later “an armed gang… seized the railroad tax book and escaped into the night.”\n\n## Reform Act Agitation\n\nDuring the rioting that followed the British parliament’s failure to pass the Reform Bill in 1831, the mob burned the custom house and excise office, along with many other government buildings.\n\n## French Revolution\n\nIn Hippolyte Taine’s history of the French Revolution, he includes several examples of attacks on tax offices:\n\n> “the crowd, rushing off to the barriers, to the gates of Sainte-Claire and Perrache, and to the Guillotière bridge, burn or demolish the bureaux, destroy the registers, sack the lodgings of the clerks, carry off the money, and pillage the wine on hand in the depôt.”\n\n> “At Limoux, under the pretext of searching for grain, they enter the houses of the comptroller and tax contractors, carry off their registers, and throw them into the water along with the furniture of their clerks.”\n\n> “at Aupt and at Luc nothing remains of the weighing-house but the four walls; at Marseilles the house of the slaughter-house contractor, at Brignolles that of the director of the leather excise, are sacked: the determination is ‘to purge the land of excise-men.’”\n\n> “…the windows of the excise office are smashed, and the public notices are torn down…”\n\n> “During the months of July and August, 1789, the tax offices are burnt in almost every town in the kingdom.”\n\n> “Without waiting, however, for any legal measures, they take the authority on themselves, rush to the toll-houses and drive out the clerks…”\n\nTaine also notes of a later revolution that “in Issoudun after the three days of July, 1830, against the combined imposts[, s]even or eight thousand vine-dressers burnt the archives and tax-offices and dragged an employé through the streets, shouting out at each street-lamp, ‘Let him be hung!’”\n\n## Masaniello’s Revolt\n\nIn Naples in 1647, a tax revolt expressed itself with attacks on tax offices:\n\n> On one beautiful summer night the custom-house in the great market-place flew up into the air. A quantity of powder had been conveyed into it by unknown hands, and in the morning nothing remained but the blackened ruins.\n\nLater: “the populace… put to flight the tax-gatherers and sbirri [police], crowded into the custom-house, destroyed the table and chairs, set fire to the ruins as well as the account-books, so that soon a bright flame rose up amidst the loud rejoicings of the bystanders.”\nThe archbishop, under pressure from the crowd, “ordered them aloud, and in the presence of all, to pull down the custom-houses.”\n\n## Attacks in Italy\n\nIn December 2011 a letter bomb exploded in the hands of the director general of Equitalia, a quasi-private company that handles taxes in Italy.\nThe following month, three bombs went off outside Equitalia’s offices in Naples.\nIn May 2012 another branch was struck with molotov cocktails. “The phrases ‘Thieves’ and ‘Death to Equitalia’ were sprayed onto outside walls.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Satherely, Jessica “The tax office that really is a nest of vipers: Farmers dump forty snakes—including deadly cobras—in protest against bribes” \u003Ci>Daily Mail Online\u003C/i> 1 December 2011\n* Cacas, Max “NTEU concerned about fed worker safety” \u003Ci>Federal News Radio\u003C/i> 10 March 2010\n* “Palestine Tax Office Bombed” Associated Press dispatch in the \u003Ci>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\u003C/i> 21 November 1946, p. 2\n* Thelen, David R. \u003Ci>Paths of Resistance: Tradition and Dignity in Industrializing Missouri\u003C/i> (1986) p. 68\n* Molesworth, W.N. \u003Ci>The History of the Reform Bill of 1832\u003C/i> (1865) pp. 295–96\n* Taine, Hippolyte \u003Ci>The French Revolution\u003C/i>, Vol I.

He also became increasingly interested in discerning what makes war tax refusers tick. I am sure he came to understand that our witness is anything but “frivolous.”\n\n## Quakers\n\nQuaker Thomas Watson was seized by the American army during the revolution, and condemned “to be stripped and ironed, and on the next afternoon to be publicly hanged” for refusing to use the continental currency that Congress had issued to finance the war.\nHis family was given little hope for him.\n“You may go home,” one petitioner was told, “and rest assured your uncle will be hanged.”\n\n> But the wife of the prisoner had a warm friend in the landlady of the inn at Newtown; and when was woman’s kindness ever invoked for the relief of suffering, or woman’s tact required in vain? She was advised not to apply in person for the release of her husband. The landlady had learned Lord Sterling’s fondness for the creaturely comforts of life; and knew that wine had the effect to soften the severity of his temper. To take advantage of this disposition, she invited him to a sumptuous dinner. He did full justice to the delicacies of the table, and willingly partook of the generous old wine, which had been reserved for special occasions. As the wine warmed the General’s good-nature and disposed him to kindlier feelings, she cautiously introduced the case of the condemned; pitied his condition, cold, and in irons; regarded his treatment as needlessly severe; and at length requested that his fetters might be removed and his clothes restored to him. He could not resist this appeal of his hostess; and a note was sent to the guard in answer to her request.\n>\n> The good woman continued her entreaties, and still plied the wine; when, at the proper moment, the wife was introduced. She fell on her knees before him, burst into a flood of tears, and told him who she was, and, with all the earnestness, feeling, and eloquence of a loving wife pleading for the one she loved best on earth, begged him to spare her husband’s life. Her entreaties were of a nature hard to be withstood. He remained some time silent; then, raising her to her feet, he said, “Madam, you have conquered. I must relent at the tears and supplications of so noble and so good a woman as you. Your husband is saved.” He immediately wrote a pardon for the prisoner, and ordered his discharge. The happy pair now returned to their homes rejoicing.\n\nBut such shows of hospitality do not always end well, as Quaker Henry Paxson learned when he was visited by the tax collector some 300 years ago.\nHe treated the collector to his best food and cider, and the ungrateful collector responded by seizing “the plates he had eaten on, and the tankard he so freely toped out of.”\n\n## Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca Rioters could be cruel, even deadly, to the keepers of the toll gates they were destroying.\nBut more frequently, they would allow the keepers a few moments to collect their personal belongings and remove them from the building before they demolished it.\nOn some occasions, the encounters were almost cordial:\n\n> The gate-keeper begged of them not to destroy the furniture, as it was his own; and his wife and child were in bed, but they might do as they liked with the gate and toll-house. Rebecca went to the door, and ordered her [Rebecca’s] daughters not to touch anything but the gate and the roof of the toll-house, and not to break the ceiling for fear the rain would harm the woman and child in bed. In their hurry, however, to unroof the house, one of them slipped between the rafters, and his foot got through the ceiling. Rebecca expressed her sorrow at the accident, as it might cause inconvenience to the gate-keeper.…\n\n> They behaved remarkably well to the gate-keeper, and frequently desired him and his wife not to be alarmed, as they would not injure them in the least; but at parting Rebecca desired him not to exact tolls at that gate any more.274\n\n## British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nDuring the tax resistance campaign for women’s suffrage in the U.K., resisters were better able to use tax auctions as rally and propaganda opportunities thanks to the respectful relationships they had developed with the auctioneers.\nOn one occasion:\n\n> …the auctioneer opened the proceedings by declaring himself a convinced Suffragist, which attitude of mind he attributed largely to a constant contact with women householders in his capacity as tax collector.\n\nWhen Kate Raleigh’s property was seized by the tax collector:\n\n> Miss Raleigh naturally made use of the occasion for propaganda purposes, conversing with the tax collector for some time on the subject of Woman Suffrage, and presenting him with Suffrage literature, which he accepted. Before taking his leave he expressed himself as, on the whole, in favour of women’s claims to enfranchisement.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Murray, Chris “Peacemakers Win!” \u003Ci>Peace Newsletter\u003C/i> (Syracuse Peace Council) October 1975, p. 17\n* Day, Dorothy “On Pilgrimage” \u003Ci>The Catholic Worker\u003C/i> October/November 1975\n* Harper, Robin “An Auditory Encounter with the IRS” \u003Ci>More Than a Paycheck\u003C/i>, June 2001\n* Watson, John “Your Uncle Will Be Hanged” \u003Ci>American Quaker War Tax Resistance\u003C/i>, 2nd. ed.

She fell on her knees before him, burst into a flood of tears, and told him who she was, and, with all the earnestness, feeling, and eloquence of a loving wife pleading for the one she loved best on earth, begged him to spare her husband’s life. Her entreaties were of a nature hard to be withstood. He remained some time silent; then, raising her to her feet, he said, “Madam, you have conquered. I must relent at the tears and supplications of so noble and so good a woman as you. Your husband is saved.” He immediately wrote a pardon for the prisoner, and ordered his discharge. The happy pair now returned to their homes rejoicing.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>But such shows of hospitality do not always end well, as Quaker Henry Paxson learned when he was visited by the tax collector some 300 years ago.\nHe treated the collector to his best food and cider, and the ungrateful collector responded by seizing “the plates he had eaten on, and the tankard he so freely toped out of.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"rebecca-riots\">Rebecca Riots\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The Rebecca Rioters could be cruel, even deadly, to the keepers of the toll gates they were destroying.\nBut more frequently, they would allow the keepers a few moments to collect their personal belongings and remove them from the building before they demolished it.\nOn some occasions, the encounters were almost cordial:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The gate-keeper begged of them not to destroy the furniture, as it was his own; and his wife and child were in bed, but they might do as they liked with the gate and toll-house.

It took seven months for the authorities to crowbar their way in and seize her dining room furniture to auction for back taxes. The Women’s Freedom League reported:\n\n> Passers-by read the bold declaration that she refuses to be taxed by a Government that refuses her representation because she is a woman. Her continued resistance has aroused keen interest in the London and Provincial Press, and afforded excellent “copy” for numerous illustrated papers.\n\nThe following year she built a stronger barricade. After trying in vain for two hours to wrestle their way in, officers resorted to a battering ram:\n\n> Finally, after a heavy beam was used as a battering ram, the door went in with a crash. The door, however, led only to a narrow passage, where a still more obstinate door barred the way. A crowbar, battering ram, and a small jemmy were here brought into use, but even with those it was nearly half an hour before the door, almost splintered, gave way. Later, the hall was entered, where the tax collector was met by Mrs. Harvey and Mrs. Despard. Here was little furniture visible, and it was not until a locksmith had forced the door of the dining room that the bailiff was able to place his levy upon goods. The amount of the tax, it is understood, is about £15.\n\nWhen the tax collector and bailiff came to seize goods from Isabella Harrison,\n\n> [She] gave instructions for the tradesmen’s entrance and windows to be locked and bolted, and herself opened the inner front door, closing it behind her and keeping her hand on the handle. The Tax Collector, who was standing with the bailiff inside the outer front door, asked if he was addressing Mrs. Darent Harrison, and hoped she would allow him to execute his trying task and produced his paper. Mrs. Harrison asked and was told the names of the local magistrates who had signed the warrant, and explained that her house could only be entered by force.… The Tax Collector protested that he could not employ force against a woman—that was quite out of the question. Mrs. Harrison then suggested that if he did not intend to stand there till he or she collapsed he must either employ force or call in the police to do so. He scoffed at the idea of sending for the police, but finally sent the bailiff to see if he could find any. But no police were to be found. The bailiff was next sent to get his dinner, and when he returned he reported “still no police anywhere to be found.” It was a complete impasse. They had been facing one another for three hours, and the Tax Collector seemed equally determined to “do his duty” and not to be guilty of even a technical assault on an elderly woman. It was only after being taunted with cowardice—with fear of the consequences of meeting moral with physical force—that he finally made an effort to get control of the handle of the door, and so with the assistance of the bailiff to force his way in.\n\nOn an earlier occasion when Harrison barricaded herself inside her home, supporters brought her food and supplies by means of a basket she lowered from a window by a rope.\n\nThere is at least one report of similar barricades in the American women’s suffrage movement. Lillie Devereaux Blake addressed a New York Women’s Suffrage Society meeting in 1873, and…\n\n> …narrated several anecdotes of vigorous ladies, who, in the security of their own castles, had defied all the approaches of the tax collector. One lady, she said, was in the habit of barricading herself in her house whenever the tax collector made his appearance, getting into a top room of the house, and from that coign of vantage, delaying the minion of the Government with potations from her parlors. [Laughter.] In this case, Mrs. Blake said it was suspected that the collector had paid the taxes himself, rather than submit to the convincing streams of the lady’s eloquence. [Laughter.]\n\n## War Tax Resisters\n\nWhen the U.S. government seized their home in 1989, war tax resisters Randy Kehler and Betsy Corner refused to leave—in defiance of a federal court order.\nWhen Kehler was arrested and imprisoned for contempt of court, a dozen affinity groups maintained a round-the-clock occupation of the home in shifts all the way through 1992.\n\nThen there’s this amusing tale:\n\n> Early one morning in 1968 Karl North (Rochester, N.Y.) was alerted by neighbors that the IRS had seized his car and was about to have it towed for $11.29 in unpaid telephone tax. Without time to grab his car key, Karl rushed out of the house and lay down under the car. This disconcerted the IRS enough that when they stopped everything to call the police, he ran back into the house, got the key, rushed back out, and drove the car off.\n\n## Blue Shirts\n\nThe Irish right-wing “Blue Shirt Party” held a rally in County Cork in August, 1934 to protest government property seizures against tax resisters.\n“While the conference was sitting, County Cork farmers felled trees in the roads, cut telephone wires and made other efforts to prevent further seizure of cattle for unpaid annuities.”\n\n## Poll Tax Resistance\n\nResisters used barricades successfully in the battle against Thatcher’s poll tax:\n\n> Over 300 people turned up outside [Jeannette McGuin’s] house. Banners were hung out of the window saying “God Help the Sheriffs.” The sheriffs didn’t show up and Jeannette McGuin never heard another word from them.… [I]n Edinburgh over 300 people filled a central high street to prevent a poinding… 200 activists guarded flats in the Grass Market area… and 150 people guarded 11 flats in Stockbridge and Comely Bank.\n\nJackie Moyers of the Mayfield/Newtongrange Anti-Poll Tax Union reported:\n\n> The very first poinding which was supposed to have been taking place was in a small village called Pathead…\n>\n> The back of eight o’clock everybody started coming up, they actually started running a relay service, a shuttle service with cars going to collect people, and I’d say by about half-past nine to ten o’clock we had 110 people standing in the garden. It was a beautiful day, it was like everybody was sunbathing, having a day out; we stood about there, everybody singing songs, we had the records on, a couple of them had a wee drink, things like that, waiting on the sheriff officers coming…\n>\n> The sheriff officers turned up, got on the phone and, lo and behold, a police car turned up… So the police came up and asked us if the sheriff officers could get in and I said, “Well, I’m telling you, under no circumstances whatsoever are we allowing any sheriff officers into anybody’s house to carry out a poinding.”\n>\n> …So the sheriff officers turned around to the police, and says “I want him arrested, because he’s organising this,” and the police says, “well, we can’t do a thing.” And everyone in the garden, I says to them, well, “They want me arrested.” They says, “Well, if you’re getting arrested then all of us are getting arrested.” And by this time, the local coalman had come up the road in his lorry, stopped his lorry and blocked the street. The two guys at the back jumped off, and the coalman who was driving the lorry, they jumped over the fence and joined us. The local council workers, who were doing the windows at the time, downed their tools and got in the garden and supported us. It’s worse than jungle drums, because the local baker heard it, he came around with his baker’s van and started dishing out cakes to us. The sheriff officers were getting quite panicky by this time. The police got in their car and left the sheriff officers. I told them again. I said, “You’d better get going. It’s a waste of your time. We know you’re not going to get in, so there’s nothing else you can do.”… They tried to get in for five or ten minutes and by this time the crowd were getting quite hostile, and I says, “I think you’d better go to your car while you’ve still got four wheels and you’re still able to walk.”\n\nAt Bishops Lydeard, people “divided up into small groups and blockaded every road into the village”:\n\n> Barricades were constructed and every vehicle which tried to enter was stopped and asked its business.… In the end, the bailiffs didn’t come near the place.\n\nPoll tax resisters also sometimes occupied or blockaded the offices of sheriffs and bailiffs.\n\n## Annuity Tax Resistance\n\nDuring the Edinburgh Annuity Tax resistance campaign, resisters used blockades to prevent property seizure and to obstruct the movement of constables when they were trying to arrest resisters.\nHere are some excerpts from testimony given during a government investigation of the Annuity Tax disturbances:\n\n> …I saw sledge hammers and other instruments there to open the premises and get at the goods, but after labouring for half an hour or more they could not effect an entrance.\n>\n> Q: Was that because Mr. Dun used some of the metal in which he was a dealer to barricade his premises?\n>\n> A: Yes; tons of metal were put up against the back door, and it was impossible for them to get in.230\n>\n> Mr. Dunn had barricaded the door of the room where the poinded effects were, so that an entrance could not be had… I found that the room where the poinded goods were was filled up to above the centre of the room with boxes filled with plates of iron of immense weight. We were told that the poinded goods were lying beneath those, and that we might get at them as we could. I sent for labourers, and had the whole of those boxes removed into the front shop until I got access, after great trouble, to the sheets of brass, which were the poinded articles. These were then declared by the sheriff officers to be of a different description, and inferior to what they had previously poinded; they refused to take them; and the only articles they recognised were some coils of copper wire; those they took to the police office, and those were all that were obtained on that occasion.\n\n## Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nDuring the Bardoli tax strike, farmers famously barricaded their homes with their cattle inside to protect them from seizure.\n\n> When the attachment operations began, minute instructions were issued to meet every situation. In the beginning only those who had received notices were to greet the attachment parties with closed doors. Then whole villages were turned into black holes, and people who could not put up with the terrible strain involved were humourously asked to undertake a pilgrimage. When it was found that in spite of the greatest precautions, the Pathans managed to carry away carts, break into enclosures and unhinge closed doors, the Sardar [resistance commander] said: “Pull your carts to pieces. Keep the body in one place, wheels in another, and shafts in a third place; make your hedges extra strong with thorns and bushes; and fortify the doors in such a way that they might not be able to open them except by breaking them open with axes. Exhaust them thoroughly.”…\n\n> In order to save their beloved cattle 80,000 men, women, children with these cattle have locked themselves up in small and insanitary houses for over three months. As I passed through villages, silent, empty and deserted with sentinels posted at different ends, I saw women peeping through the barred windows to see whether it was the arrival of the \u003Ci>japti\u003C/i> [attachment] officer and, on being reassured, the doors being opened, I was taken inside and I saw the darkness, the stench, the filth; and the men, women and children who had herded for months in the same room with their beloved cattle—miserable, lacerated, grown whitish by disease—and as I heard their determination to remain in that condition for months rather than abandon their cattle to the tender mercies of the \u003Ci>japti\u003C/i> officer I could not help thinking that the imagination which conceived the dire \u003Ci>japti\u003C/i> methods, the severity which had enforced them, and the policy which had sanctioned them were difficult to be found outside the pages of a history of medieval times.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Nym Mayhall, Laura E. \u003Ci>The Militant Suffrage Movement: Citizenship and Resistance in Britain, 1860–1930\u003C/i> (2003) pp. 34–35\n* Montefiore, Dora \u003Ci>From a Victorian to a Modern\u003C/i> (1925)\n* “Mrs. Harvey’s Unbroken Barricade” \u003Ci>The Vote\u003C/i> 15 June 1912, p. 134\n* “Battering Ram Used” \u003Ci>Adelaide Register\u003C/i> 29 December 1913, p. 9\n* “Tax Resistance” \u003Ci>The Vote\u003C/i> 13 July 1917, p. 282\n* “The New-York Woman’s Suffrage Society” \u003Ci>The New York Times\u003C/i> 17 December 1873\n* Hedemann, Ed “War Tax Resisters in History” \u003Ci>More Than a Paycheck\u003C/i> October/November 2010, p. 7\n* “Irish Blue Shirts Plan Tax Strike” Associated Press dispatch found in the \u003Ci>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\u003C/i>, 20 August 1934, p. 2\n* “Blue Shirts On Guard” Havas dispatch found in \u003Ci>The Montreal Gazette\u003C/i>, 15 August 1935, p. 3\n* Burns, Danny \u003Ci>Poll Tax Rebellion\u003C/i> AK Press (1992), p. 153–57\n* \u003Ci>Report from the Select Committee on the Edinburgh Annuity Tax Abolition Act\u003C/i> (1866), pp. 88, 101\n* Desai, Mahadev \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i> (1929) pp. 171–72, 218\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/docs/tacticsthatfrustratecountermeasures/blockadetaxcollectors.md","5b6fa5dd1e89a82e",{"html":789,"metadata":790},"\u003Cp>Tax resisters and tax resistance campaigns have at times used barricades, blockades, and occupations to keep tax collectors at bay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-womens-suffrage-movements\">The Women’s Suffrage Movements\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>For example, there were a number of prominent “sieges” in the tax resistance campaign that accompanied the British women’s suffrage movement.\nDora Montefiore barred the doorway of her home against the bailiffs in 1906 and held out for six weeks before they broke through—all the while “addressing the frequent crowds through the upper windows of the house.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>WSPU [Women’s Social and Political Union] meetings were held in front of the house daily, and resolutions were taken “that taxation without representation is tyranny.” After six weeks, the Crown was legally authorized to break down the door in order to seize property in lieu of taxes, a process to which Montefiore submitted, saying, “It was useless to resist \u003Ci>force majeure\u003C/i> when it came to technical violence on the part of the authorities.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>The “Siege of Montefiore” was a publicity coup for the movement, and served as a useful rallying point for activists.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>On the little terrace of the front garden hung during the whole time of the siege a red banner with the letters painted in white: “Women should vote for the laws they obey and the taxes they pay.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Kate Harvey barricaded her home in 1912.

The entire poll taxes [collected by the city] for the year are only $325.…”\n\n## The Anti-Poll Tax Unions\n\nThe campaign against Thatcher’s poll tax succeeded in clogging the courts.\nIn theory, everyone summonsed for refusal to pay the tax had a legal right to have their case heard, but the councils that implemented the tax were counting on people just rolling over and letting the government have its way without a fight.\n\nCampaign chronicler Danny Burns wrote:\n\n> Initially, neither the councils nor the courts took the judicial procedure seriously because they didn’t expect anyone to turn up… South Tyndale Council summoned 3,500 to appear on two afternoons. A total of five hours was allocated to hear all these cases—an average of four seconds per hearing. When people heard this they were furious, because it was obvious that both the council and the courts saw the process as rubber stamping exercise.…\n\nThe “Anti-Poll Tax Unions” that formed the backbone of the campaign saw this as an exploitable weakness of the government, and they decided to encourage as many people as possible to show up in court and press their cases in the most time- and resource-consuming way the law would permit.\n\n> …People were given ideas about how they might disrupt or delay the court proceedings. These included simple things, like asking for a glass of water because their throat was dry, demanding to see the identity cards of everyone present in court, to fainting in court or arranging for fire alarms to go off. People were told to demand their rights to see and read every document which was produced as evidence against them. They were also given briefings on the basic technical arguments.\n>\n> …Throughout England and Wales over a thousand people were trained to do court support work and could quote the relevant legislation…\n>\n> Experience showed that the most effective way of wasting time, for those who were not familiar with the law, was to relate direct experiences of hardship. People talking in their own language about their own circumstances were much harder for the magistrates to dismiss than legal technicians. Many people made political speeches which lasted for as long as ten minutes, others outlined their financial circumstances. They all took up valuable time, and sometimes made a powerful and moving impact on the public gallery.\n\nSometimes just showing up was enough to crash the system.\nIn Warrington, 1,000 people turned up to contest their cases, and the court, unable to cope, shut down for the day and postponed all of the scheduled cases.\nIn Southwark, 1,500 people came to court and made things so unwieldy that “the police were stopping people from coming into their own court cases.…[and] the court declared all 5,000 cases adjourned.”\n\n## Turn-about Is Fair Play\n\nUsing the government’s own defenses against it can be a powerful strategy.\nI’ve even got an example in my archives of when the government used this sort of ju-jitsu and managed to frustrate nonviolent tax resisters by using their tactics against them.\n\nDuring the Salt Raids in the Indian independence campaign, a group of policemen blockaded the road in front of an assembly of raiders, and sent another group to cut off their escape route.\nThen, rather than attacking the raiders, the police used satyagraha tactics to force a standoff:\n\n> “You cannot proceed.” the superintendent informed Mrs. [Sarojini] Naidu.\n>\n> “We will not go back,” the poetess and leader replied. “We will stay here.”\n>\n> “We are going to stay here, too, and offer satyagraha ourselves as long as you stay,” the superintendent said, ordering his men to stand their ground.\n>\n> They parleyed for a short time and then Mrs. Naidu ordered a chair brought from a nearby house. She sat down and wrote letters and talked jovially with her friends. Her followers squatted on the ground nearby, many of them engaged in spinning cloth.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* “John Smith, Martyr” \u003Ci>The New York Times\u003C/i> 9 December 1879\n* “Socialist Refuses to Pay Poll Tax” \u003Ci>The New York Call\u003C/i> 26 April 1910, p. 5\n* Burns, Danny \u003Ci>Poll Tax Rebellion\u003C/i> (1992) p. 134–35, 138–40\n* \u003Ci>Counter Information\u003C/i> No. 30, February 1991 (quoted in Burns, Danny op. cit., p. 135)\n* Low, Francis “Salt Works Raid Cleverly Halted” \u003Ci>Altoona Mirror\u003C/i> 15 May 1930, p. 1\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/docs/tacticsthatfrustratecountermeasures/clogthecourtsorjails.md","86670730a7499a64",{"html":846,"metadata":847},"\u003Cp>Some tax resistance campaigns have tried to make tax enforcement or government reprisals against tax resisters costly for the government by clogging the jails or the court system.\nThis can force the government into a checkmate, where if it fails to take legal action against resisters it loses, and if it takes action it also loses.\nBut by forcing resisters to throw themselves onto the gears of the machine, this tactic can be costly to them as well, and can make this tactic something of a game of chicken or a war of attrition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"john-brown-smith-and-jj-keon\">John Brown Smith and J.J.

When people heard this they were furious, because it was obvious that both the council and the courts saw the process as rubber stamping exercise.…\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>The “Anti-Poll Tax Unions” that formed the backbone of the campaign saw this as an exploitable weakness of the government, and they decided to encourage as many people as possible to show up in court and press their cases in the most time- and resource-consuming way the law would permit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>…People were given ideas about how they might disrupt or delay the court proceedings. These included simple things, like asking for a glass of water because their throat was dry, demanding to see the identity cards of everyone present in court, to fainting in court or arranging for fire alarms to go off. People were told to demand their rights to see and read every document which was produced as evidence against them. They were also given briefings on the basic technical arguments.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>…Throughout England and Wales over a thousand people were trained to do court support work and could quote the relevant legislation…\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Experience showed that the most effective way of wasting time, for those who were not familiar with the law, was to relate direct experiences of hardship. People talking in their own language about their own circumstances were much harder for the magistrates to dismiss than legal technicians. Many people made political speeches which lasted for as long as ten minutes, others outlined their financial circumstances. They all took up valuable time, and sometimes made a powerful and moving impact on the public gallery.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Sometimes just showing up was enough to crash the system.\nIn Warrington, 1,000 people turned up to contest their cases, and the court, unable to cope, shut down for the day and postponed all of the scheduled cases.\nIn Southwark, 1,500 people came to court and made things so unwieldy that “the police were stopping people from coming into their own court cases.…[and] the court declared all 5,000 cases adjourned.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"turn-about-is-fair-play\">Turn-about Is Fair Play\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Using the government’s own defenses against it can be a powerful strategy.\nI’ve even got an example in my archives of when the government used this sort of ju-jitsu and managed to frustrate nonviolent tax resisters by using their tactics against them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>During the Salt Raids in the Indian independence campaign, a group of policemen blockaded the road in front of an assembly of raiders, and sent another group to cut off their escape route.\nThen, rather than attacking the raiders, the police used satyagraha tactics to force a standoff:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“You cannot proceed.” the superintendent informed Mrs. [Sarojini] Naidu.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“We will not go back,” the poetess and leader replied. “We will stay here.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“We are going to stay here, too, and offer satyagraha ourselves as long as you stay,” the superintendent said, ordering his men to stand their ground.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They parleyed for a short time and then Mrs. Naidu ordered a chair brought from a nearby house.

His resistance publicised the arrests, and the citizens immediately organised themselves for the release of the prisoners. The morning after the arrests, a large crowd of furious Muslims surrounded the Governor’s residence, demanding the return of the exiles. The Governor escaped to a private house, but was captured and kept prisoner in the İbrahim Pasha Mosque.\n\nThe crowd then took revenge against the local police (beating the Chief of Police to death), and went to retrieve exiled resistance leaders, “the Governor having been compelled under the threat of death to give orders for their return.”\n\n## The Whiskey and Fries Rebels\n\nAlexander Hamilton complained of the American Whiskey Rebels that “armed banditti ventured to seize and carry off two persons who were witnesses against the rioters… in order to prevent their giving testimony…”\n\nThe American tax rebels in the Fries Rebellion a few years later did what they could to break their comrades out of custody:\n\n> As soon as it became known the arrests were made, the leaders of the opposition to the law determined to rescue them… Notices were carried around the evening before and left at the houses of those known to be friendly to the movement. By ten o’clock a number of people had assembled, and considerable excitement was manifested. The general sentiment was in favor of immediate organization and marching to Bethlehem to take the prisoners from the hands of the Marshal. The crowd was formed in a company, and John Fries elected captain. They were variously armed; some with guns, others with swords and pistols, while those with less belligerent feelings carried clubs.\n\nFries led a group of about 140 armed rebels to the building where the prisoners were held, and then after a tense standoff with the Marshal and about twenty of his posse, the rebels won the release of the prisoners.\nVictory was sweet, but brief, as this event provoked President John Adams to send in federal troops.\n(Fries and some of his companions were captured, convicted of treason, and sentenced to be hanged; Adams pardoned them.)\n\n## Jack a Lents\n\nThe “Jack a Lents”—18th century English forefathers to the Welsh Rebecca Rioters—rescued two of their number who had been arrested for toll booth destruction.\nA news account said:\n\n> [They] demanded the said prisoners, threatening, in case of refusal, to pull [their captor’s] house down, and burn his barns and stables, and immediately discharged several loaded pieces into the house, which happily did no damage. The justice finding himself and family beset in such a manner, discharged several blunderbusses and fowling-pieces at them, whereby one was shot dead on the spot, and several so wounded that ’tis not believed they will recover. At this the rioters fled with precipitation, leaving their two companions behind them.\n\nBut the Jack a Lents weren’t giving up.

The bailiffs attempted to levy on the pigs of a farmer who refused to pay, but the farmer had carefully lathered the porkers with grease and the bailiffs gave it up. A Birmingham auctioneer tried to sell some goods that had been seized but he no sooner opened his mouth to announce the sale when an ancient egg cracked over his teeth and a cabbage hit him on the nose. The auctioneer immediately retired to Birmingham. There is great excitement and the police hesitate to answer the demands of the tithe collectors for assistance fearing a riot if they interfere.\n\n### Education Act-related Resistance\n\nSome disruption of auctions took place during the tax resistance campaign against the provisions of the Education Act of 1902 that provided taxpayer money for sectarian education.\nOne resister named his sheep after offensive politicians so as to turn their auction into an occasion for political commentary:\n\n> Difficulty is experienced everywhere in getting auctioneers to sell the property confiscated. In Leominster, a ram and some ewe lambs, the property of a resistant named Charles Grundy, were seized and put up at auction, as follows: Ram, Joe Chamberlain; ewes, Lady Balfour, Mrs. Bishop, Lady Cecil, Mrs. Canterbury, and so on through the list of those who made themselves conspicuous in forcing the bill through Parliament. The auctioneer was entitled to a fee under the law of 10 shillings and 6 pence, which he promptly turned over to Mr. Grundy, having during the sale expressed the strongest sympathy for the tax-resisters. Most of the auction sales are converted into political meetings in which the tax and those responsible for it are roundly denounced.\n\n### Edinburgh Annuity Tax Resistance\n\nAuction disruptions were commonplace in the Annuity Tax resistance campaign in Edinburgh. By law the distraint auctions (or “roupings”) had to be held either at the homes of the resisters or at the Mercat Cross—the town square, essentially—which made it easy to gather a crowd:\n\n> [I]magine… an unfortunate auctioneer arriving at the Cross about noon, with a cart loaded with furniture for sale. Latterly the passive hubbub rose as if by magic. Bells sounded, bagpipes brayed, the Fiery Cross passed down the closses, and through the High Street and Cowgate; and men, women, and children, rushed from all points towards the scene of \u003Cem>Passive Resistance\u003C/em>… Respectable shopkeepers might be seen coming in haste from the Bridges; Irish traders flew from St. Mary’s Wynd; brokers from the Cowgate; all pressing round the miserable auctioneer; yelling, hooting, perhaps cursing, certainly saying anything but what was affectionate or respectful of the clergy. And here were the black placards tossing above the heads of the angry multitude—\n>\n> ROUPING FOR STIPEND!\n>\n> This notice was of itself enough to deter any one from purchasing… The people lodged the placards and flags in shops about the Cross, so that not a moment was lost in having their machinery in full operation, and scouts were ever ready to spread the intelligence if any symptoms of a sale were discovered.\n\nIt was difficult for the authorities to get any help at all, either from auctioneers, furniture dealers, or carters. The government had to purchase (and fortify) their own cart because they were unable to rent one for such use.\n\nBefore a committee that was investigating the resistance campaign, a witness testified about a disrupted auction that was held at a resister’s home:\n\n> I saw a large number of the most respectable citizens assembled in the house, and a large number outside awaiting the arrival of the officers who came in a cab, and the indignation was very strong when they got into the house, so much so that a feeling was entertained by some that there was danger to the life of Mr. Whitten, the auctioneer, and that he might be thrown out of the window, because there were such threats, but others soothed down the feeling.…\n>\n> Q: Did Mr. Whitten, from his experience on that occasion, refuse ever to come to another sale as auctioneer?\n>\n> A: He refused to act again, he gave up his position.\n\nOn another occasion, the auction seemed to go smoothly at first, but the buyers didn’t get what they hoped for:\n\n> At Mr. McLaren’s sale everything was conducted in an orderly way as far as the sale was concerned. We got in, and only a limited number were allowed to go in; but after the officials and the police had gone, there was a certain amount of disturbance. Certain goods were knocked down [sold] to the poinding creditors, consisting of an old sofa and an old sideboard, and Mr. McLaren said, “Let those things go to the clergy.” Those were the only things which had to be taken away. There was no vehicle ready to carry them away. Mr. McLaren said that he would not keep them. After the police departed, he turned them out in the street, when they were taken possession of by the crowd of idlers, and made a bonfire of.\n\nA summary of the effect of all of this disruption reads:\n\n> So strong was the feeling of hostility, that the town council were unable to procure the services of any auctioneer… and they were consequently forced to make a special arrangement with a sheriff’s officer, by which, to induce him to undertake the disagreeable task, they provided him for two years with an auctioneer’s license from the police funds. In March 1865, it was found necessary to enter into another arrangement with the officer, by which the council had to pay him 12½ percent, on all arrears, including the police, prison, and registration rates, as well as the clerical tax; and he receives this percentage whether the sums are recovered by himself or paid direct to the police collector, and that over and above all the expenses he recovers from the recusants. But this is not all; the council were unable to hire a cart or vehicle from any of the citizens, and it was found necessary to purchase a lorry, and to provide all the necessary apparatus and assistance for enforcing payment of the arrears. All this machinery, which owes its existence entirely to the Clerico-Police Act, involves a wasteful expenditure of city funds, induces a chronic state of irritation in the minds of the citizens, and is felt to be a gross violation of the principles of civil and religious liberty.\n\n### The Tithe War\n\nWilliam John Fitzpatrick wrote of the auctions during the Tithe War in Ireland:\n\n> [T]he parson’s first step was to put the cattle up to auction in the presence of a regiment of English soldiery; but it almost invariably happened that either the assembled spectators were afraid to bid, lest they should incur the vengeance of the peasantry, or else they stammered out such a low offer, that, when knocked down, the expenses of the sale would be found to exceed it. The same observation applies to the crops. Not one man in a hundred had the hardihood to declare himself the purchaser. Sometimes the parson… would order the cattle twelve or twenty miles away in order to their being a second time put up for auction. But the locomotive progress of the beasts was always closely tracked, and means were taken to prevent either driver or beast receiving shelter or sustenance throughout the march.\n\nThe Sentinel wrote of one auction:\n\n> Yesterday being the day on which the sheriff announced that, if no bidders could be obtained for the cattle, he would have the property returned to Mr. Germain, immense crowds were collected from the neighbouring counties—upwards of 20,000 men. The County Kildare men, amounting to about 7,000, entered… in the most regular and orderly manner. This body was preceded by a band of music, and had several banners on which were “Kilkea and Moone, Independence for ever,” “No Church Tax,” “No Tithe,” “Liberty,” etc… The cattle were ordered out, when the sheriff, as on the former day, put them up for sale; but no one could be found to bid for the cattle, upon which he announced his intention of returning them to Mr. Germain. The news was instantly conveyed, like electricity, throughout the entire meeting, when the huzzas of the people surpassed anything we ever witnessed. The cattle were instantly liberated and given up to Mr. Germain.… Thus terminated this extraordinary contest between the Church and the people, the latter having obtained, by their steadiness, a complete victory. The cattle will be given to the poor of the sundry districts.\n\nSimilar scenes were reported elsewhere:\n\n> Some cows seized for tithes were brought to a public place for sale, escorted by a squadron of lancers, and followed by thousands of infuriated people. All the garrison, cavalry and infantry, under the command of Sir George Bingham, were called out. The cattle were set up at three pounds for each, no bidder; two pounds, no bidder; one pound, no bidder; in short, the auctioneer descended to three shillings for each cow, but no purchaser appeared. This scene lasted for above an hour, when there being no chance of making sale of the cattle, it was proposed to adjourn the auction; but, as we are informed, the General in command of the military expressed an unwillingness to have the troops subjected to a repetition of the harassing duty thus imposed on them. After a short delay, it was, at the interference and remonstrance of several gentlemen, both of town and country, agreed upon that the cattle should be given up to the people, subject to certain private arrangements. We never witnessed such a scene; thousands of country people jumping with exulted feelings at the result, wielding their shillelaghs, and exhibiting all the other symptoms of exuberant joy characteristic of the buoyancy of Irish feeling.\n>\n> At Carlow… Some cattle had been seized for tithe, and a public sale announced, when a large body of men, stated at 50,000, marched to the place appointed, and, of course, under the influence of such terror, none were found to bid for the cattle. The sale was adjourned from day to day, for seven days, and upon each day the same organised bands entered the town, and rendered the attempt to sell the cattle, in pursuance of the law, abortive. At last the cattle are given up to the mob, crowned with laurels, and driven home with an escort of 10,000 men.\n\n## The British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nThe tax resisters in the women’s suffrage movement in the U.K. were particularly adept at disrupting tax auctions and making them opportunities for propaganda and protest.\n\n> Practically every day sees a sale and protest somewhere, and the banners of the Women’s Tax Resistance League, frequently supported by Suffrage Societies, are becoming familiar in town and country. At the protest meetings which follow all sales the reason why is explained to large numbers of people who would not attend a suffrage meeting. Auctioneers are becoming sympathetic even so far as to speak in support of the women’s protest against a law which demands their money, but gives them no voice in the way in which it is spent.\n\nSometimes sympathetic auctioneers would allow activists in to address bidders before the auction began.\nIn this way, the auctions spread the suffragist message to new audiences.\nIndeed, the suffragists would often walk through town with sandwich-boards, banners, and leaflets advertising and protesting the auction to try to draw a crowd.\n\nAt one auction, a suffrage activist called out for “three cheers” for the tax resister whose goods had been auctioned off, and “[t]he hearty response from the men… came as a surprise to the Suffragists themselves.”\nOn another, the gathering came to resemble a suffrage rally more than an auction:\n\n> The sale was conducted, laughably enough, under the auspices of the Women’s Freedom League and the Women’s Tax Resistance League… The rostrum was spread with our flag proclaiming the inauguration of Tax Resistance by the W.F.L.; above the auctioneer’s head hung Mrs. Despard’s embroidered silk banner, with its challenge “Dare to be Free”; on every side the green, white and gold of the W.F.L. was accompanied by the brown and black of the Women’s Tax Resistance League, with its cheery “No Vote, no Tax” injunctions and its John Hampden maxims…\n\nSometimes these protests convinced the assembled bidders to refuse to bid on the stolen goods:\n\n> Miss Andrews asked the auctioneer if she might explain the reason for the sale of the waggon, and, having received the necessary permission was able to give an address on tax resistance, and to show how it is one of the weapons employed by the Freedom League to secure the enfranchisement of women. Then came the sale—but beforehand the auctioneer said he had not been aware he was to sell “distressed” goods, and he very much objected to doing so.… The meeting and the auctioneer together made the assembly chary of bidding, and the waggon was not sold, which was a great triumph for the tax-resisters.\n\nA less-sympathetic auctioneer might refuse to allow the activists to address the crowd from the rostrum, only to regret this decision when the activists would instead shout him down from the crowd or from the street outside.\n\nWhen the government seized the goods of tax resisters and auctioned them off, this overt attack tended to unify the opposition and make it overlook its own differences of opinion.\nOne suffragist activist wrote about an auction protest:\n\n> Certainly the most striking feature of this protest was the fact that members of all societies in Hastings, St. Leonards, Bexhill, and Winchelsea united in their effort to render the protest representative of all shades of Suffrage opinion. Flags, banners, pennons, and regalia of many societies were seen in the procession.\n\nThe government once peevishly seized about £80 worth of household goods from a woman who had only resisted about £15 in taxes:\n\n> [I]t was at once decided by the Women’s Tax Resistance League and Mrs. Tollemache’s friends that such conduct on the part of the authorities must be circumvented and exposed. The goods were on view the morning of the sale, and as there was much valuable old china, silver, and furniture, the dealers were early on the spot, and buzzing like flies around the articles they greatly desired to possess. The first two pieces put up were, fortunately, quite inviting; £19 being bid for a chest of drawers worth about 50s. and £3 for an ordinary leather-top table, the requisite amount was realised, and the auctioneer was obliged to withdraw the remaining lots, much to the disgust of the assembled dealers. Mrs. Kineton Parkes, in her speech at the protest meeting, which followed the sale, explained to these irate gentlemen that women never took such steps unless compelled to do so, and that if the tax collector had seized a legitimate amount of goods to satisfy his claim, Mrs. Tollemache would willingly have allowed them to go.”\n\nThe government tried to sell suffragist tax resister Kate Harvey’s property from within her home rather than from a public auction house, thinking that this might make protest more difficult.\nThis turned out to be a miscalculation.\nA group of suffragist men drew a crowd by carrying placards through the town that read “I personally protest against the sale of a woman’s goods to pay taxes over which she has no control.”\nWhen the sale began that afternoon, the crowd and the hubbub had become so intense that the first thing the auctioneer did was to reassure people that it really was an auction they were attending.\n\nKate Harvey then addressed the crowd and explained why she was resisting (“Simply and solely because she was a woman… she had no voice in saying how the taxes collected from her should be spent.”)\n\n> The tax collector suffered this speech in silence, but he could judge by the cheers it received that there were many ardent sympathisers with Mrs. Harvey in her protest. He tried to proceed, but one after another the men present loudly urged that no one there should bid for the goods. The tax-collector feebly said this wasn’t a political meeting, but a genuine sale! “One penny for your goods then!” was the derisive answer. “One penny—one penny!” was the continued cry.…\n>\n> The din increased every moment and pandemonium reigned supreme. During a temporary lull the tax-collector said a sideboard had been sold for nine guineas. Angry cries from angry men greeted this announcement. “Illegal sale!” “He shan’t take it home!” “The whole thing’s illegal!” “You shan’t sell anything else!” and \u003Ci>The Daily Herald\u003C/i> Leaguers, members of the Men’s Political Union, and of other men’s societies, proceeded to make more noise than twenty brass bands. Darkness was quickly settling in; the tax-collector looked helpless, and his deputy smiled wearily. “Talk about a comic opera—it’s better than Gilbert and Sullivan could manage,” roared an enthusiast. “My word, you look sick, guv’nor! Give it up, man!” Then everyone shouted against the other until the tax-collector said he closed the sale, remarking plaintively that he had lost £7 over the job! Ironical cheers greeted this news, with “Serve you right for stealing a woman’s goods!” He turned his back on his tormentors, and sat down in a chair on the table to think things over. The protesters sat on the sideboard informing all and sundry that if anyone wanted to take away the sideboard he should take them with it! With the exit of the tax-collector, his deputy and the bailiff, things gradually grew quieter, and later on Mrs. Harvey entertained her supporters to tea at the Bell Hotel. But the curious thing is, a man paid nine guineas for the sideboard to the tax-collector. Mrs. Harvey owed him more than £17, and Mrs. Harvey is still in possession of the sideboard!\n\n## The American War Tax Resistance Movement\n\nThere have been a few celebrated auction sales in the American war tax resistance movement.\nSome were met with protests or were used as opportunities for outreach, but others have been more actively interfered with.\n\nWhen Ernest and Marion Bromley’s home was seized, for example, there were “months of continuous picketing and leafletting” before the sale.\nThen:\n\n> The day began with a silent vigil initiated by the local Quaker group. While the bids were being read inside the building, guerilla theatre took place out on the sidewalk. At one point the Federal building was auctioned (offers ranging from 25¢ to two bottle caps). Several supporters present at the proceedings inside made brief statements about the unjust nature of the whole ordeal. Waldo the Clown was also there, face painted sadly, opening envelopes along with the IRS person. As the official read the bids and the names of the bidders, Waldo searched his envelopes and revealed their contents: a flower, a unicorn, some toilet paper, which he handed to different office people. Marion Bromley also spoke as the bids were opened, reiterating that the seizure was based on fraudulent assumptions, and that therefore the property could not be rightfully sold.\n\nThese protests, odd as they were, eventually paid off.\nAround the same time that this auction was taking place, the IRS was caught improperly pursuing political dissidents.\nAs the scandal broke the agency decided to reverse the sale of the Bromley home and to give up on that particular fight.\n\nWhen Addie and Paul Snyder’s home was auctioned off for back taxes, it was reported that “many bids of $1 or less were made.”\nA newspaper article on the auction noted:\n\n> Making a bid of pennies for farm property being foreclosed for failure to meet mortgages was a common tactic among angry farmers during the Depression. If their bids succeeded, the property was returned to its owner and the mortgage torn up. In some such cases, entire farms plus their livestock, equipment and home furnishings sold for as little as $2.209.\n\nWhen Randy Kehler and Betsy Corner’s home was being put up in a sealed-bid auction, “The IRS received close to 100 bids, but none was monetary.”\nBids included a package of community service pledges and food for the poor, massages or psychotherapy for IRS employees, free dental work for IRS employees, nonviolence training sessions, and “42 blocks of ice, to symbolize the end of the 42-year Cold War.”\nThe tax agency rejected all the bids.\n\nYou don’t need to disrupt the auction itself in order to frustrate the tax authorities.\nThe seizure and auctioning of a resister’s property is meant to be punitive and discouraging, so if you can make it instead celebratory and \u003Cem>encouraging\u003C/em>, you may have disrupted the auction even if it proceeds as normal.\nWhen the IRS seized George and Lillian Willoughby’s car to recover about $100 in refused telephone excise tax, the Willoughbys’ friends and supporters raised what they called a “peace bond” of money so they could buy the car back at auction—and they donated the extra money from the “bond” to the local war tax resistance group.\nGeorge Willoughby remembers: “One IRS official complained, ‘here we seize your car to raise money for the IRS, and you are using it to raise money for your cause!’ ”\n\n## Reform Act Agitation\n\nDuring the tax resistance that accompanied the drive to pass the Reform Act in the early 1830s in the U.K., hundreds of people signed pledges in which they declared that “they will not purchase the goods of their townsmen not represented in Parliament which may be seized for the non-payment of taxes.”\nA news account asserted:\n\n> The tax-gatherer… might seize for them, but the brokers assured the inhabitants that they would neither seize any goods for such taxes, nor would they purchase goods so seized. Yesterday afternoon, Mr Philips, a broker, in the Broadway, Westminster, exhibited the following placard at the door of his shop:—“Take notice, that the proprietor of this shop will not distrain for the house and window duties, nor will he purchase any goods that are seized for the said taxes; neither will any of those oppressive taxes be paid for this house in future.”\n\nAnd another said:\n\n> A sale by auction of goods taken in distress for assessed taxes was announced.… From forty to fifty persons attended, including some brokers, but no buyer could be found except the poor woman from whose husband the goods had been seized, and the auctioneer himself. A man came when the sale was nearly over, who was perfectly ignorant of the circumstances under which it took place, and bid for one of the last lots; he soon received an intimation, however, from the company that he had better desist, which be accordingly did. After the sale was over nearly the whole of the persons present surrounded this man, and lectured him severely upon his conduct, and it was only by his solemnly declaring to them that he had bid in perfect ignorance of the nature of the sale that he was suffered to escape without some more substantial proof of their displeasure.\n\n## Railroad Bond Shenanigans\n\nThere was an epidemic of fraud in the United States in the late nineteenth century in which local jurisdictions were convinced to issue bonds to pay for the railroad to come to town.\nThe railroad never arrived, but the citizens then were on the hook to tax themselves to pay off the bond-holders.\nMany groups of citizens refused, but by then the bonds had been sold to people who were not necessarily involved in the original swindle but who had just bought them as investments, and who filed lawsuits to compel payment.\n\nAuctions were sometimes disrupted in the course of the tax resistance campaigns associated with these railroad bond boondoggles.\nHere are two examples:\n\n> St. Clair [Missouri]’s taxpayers joined the movement in the 1870s to repudiate the debts, but the county’s new leaders wanted to repay the investors. Afraid to try taxing the residents, they decided to raise the interest by staging a huge livestock auction in 1876, the proceeds to pay off the railroad bond interest. On auction day, however, “no one seemed to want to buy” any animals. To bondholders the “great shock” of the auction’s failure proved the depth of local resistance to railroad taxes.\n\n> Another attempt was made… and another failure has followed. The scene was upon the farm of William Atkins, where 200 of the solid yeomanry of the town had assembled to resist the sale… A Mr. Updyke, with broader hint, made these remarks: “I want to tell you folks that Mr. Atkins has paid all of his tax except this railroad tax; and we consider any man who will buy our property… as contemptible sharks. We shall remember him for years, and will know where he lives.” The tax collector finally rose and remarked that in view of the situation he would not attempt to proceed with the sale.\n\n## The White League in Louisiana\n\nIn Reconstruction-era Louisiana, a mob of white supremacist tax resisters disrupted a tax auction.\nOne struck the auctioneer when he attempted to sell distrained property, and dozens of others, armed with revolvers, backed him up.\nAs a result:\n\n> …very few people attended tax-sales [typically], because the white people were organized to prevent tax-collection, and pledged themselves not to buy any property at tax-sales, and the property was generally bought by the State.\n\n## Piet Bezuidenhout’s Wagon\n\nThe First Boer War broke out in the aftermath of the successfully resisted auction of a tax resister’s wagon.\nThe Boers had been paying their taxes to the British reluctantly, but the British brazenly used this reluctant compliance as evidence that the Boers were content under British rule.\nInfuriated, Boer separatists declared they would refuse to pay or would only pay under protest.\nThe British criminally charged the publisher of a Pretoria newspaper for having printed such tax resistance vows.\n\nThe British government took Piet Bezuidenhout to court to try to force him to pay about twice the amount of taxes as was actually lawfully due.\nBezuidenhout offered to pay the actual amount due under protest—an offer the court eventually accepted, but only after adding court costs that brought the total back up to exactly the inflated amount the government had originally asked for.\nBezuidenhout, unwilling to be swindled in this way, refused to pay.\n\nThe government then seized his wagon and attempted to auction it off, but a hundred armed Boers stormed the auction, assaulted the sheriff who was to conduct the sale, and hauled the wagon away.\nWhen the government raised a squadron of police to try to recapture Bezuidenhout, the Boers assembled a small army to resist this attempt.\nRealizing they had forced matters to a head, the Boers declared independence and decided to fight it out.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* \u003Ci>The Daily Saratogian\u003C/i> 28 May 1892, p. 4\n* “The passive resistance of the nonconformists…” \u003Ci>San Francisco Chronicle\u003C/i> 19 October 1903, p. 6\n* “The Passive Resistance of Edinburgh, to the Clergy-Tax” \u003Ci>Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine\u003C/i> September 1833, pp. 795–802\n* \u003Ci>Report from the Select Committee on the Edinburgh Annuity Tax Abolition Act\u003C/i> (1866) pp. 88, 151\n* Fitzpatrick, William John \u003Ci>The Life, Times, and Correspondence of the Right Rev.

The auctioneer was entitled to a fee under the law of 10 shillings and 6 pence, which he promptly turned over to Mr. Grundy, having during the sale expressed the strongest sympathy for the tax-resisters.

There was no vehicle ready to carry them away. Mr. McLaren said that he would not keep them. After the police departed, he turned them out in the street, when they were taken possession of by the crowd of idlers, and made a bonfire of.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>A summary of the effect of all of this disruption reads:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>So strong was the feeling of hostility, that the town council were unable to procure the services of any auctioneer… and they were consequently forced to make a special arrangement with a sheriff’s officer, by which, to induce him to undertake the disagreeable task, they provided him for two years with an auctioneer’s license from the police funds. In March 1865, it was found necessary to enter into another arrangement with the officer, by which the council had to pay him 12½ percent, on all arrears, including the police, prison, and registration rates, as well as the clerical tax; and he receives this percentage whether the sums are recovered by himself or paid direct to the police collector, and that over and above all the expenses he recovers from the recusants. But this is not all; the council were unable to hire a cart or vehicle from any of the citizens, and it was found necessary to purchase a lorry, and to provide all the necessary apparatus and assistance for enforcing payment of the arrears. All this machinery, which owes its existence entirely to the Clerico-Police Act, involves a wasteful expenditure of city funds, induces a chronic state of irritation in the minds of the citizens, and is felt to be a gross violation of the principles of civil and religious liberty.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"the-tithe-war\">The Tithe War\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>William John Fitzpatrick wrote of the auctions during the Tithe War in Ireland:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>[T]he parson’s first step was to put the cattle up to auction in the presence of a regiment of English soldiery; but it almost invariably happened that either the assembled spectators were afraid to bid, lest they should incur the vengeance of the peasantry, or else they stammered out such a low offer, that, when knocked down, the expenses of the sale would be found to exceed it. The same observation applies to the crops. Not one man in a hundred had the hardihood to declare himself the purchaser. Sometimes the parson… would order the cattle twelve or twenty miles away in order to their being a second time put up for auction. But the locomotive progress of the beasts was always closely tracked, and means were taken to prevent either driver or beast receiving shelter or sustenance throughout the march.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>The Sentinel wrote of one auction:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Yesterday being the day on which the sheriff announced that, if no bidders could be obtained for the cattle, he would have the property returned to Mr. Germain, immense crowds were collected from the neighbouring counties—upwards of 20,000 men. The County Kildare men, amounting to about 7,000, entered… in the most regular and orderly manner. This body was preceded by a band of music, and had several banners on which were “Kilkea and Moone, Independence for ever,” “No Church Tax,” “No Tithe,” “Liberty,” etc… The cattle were ordered out, when the sheriff, as on the former day, put them up for sale; but no one could be found to bid for the cattle, upon which he announced his intention of returning them to Mr. Germain. The news was instantly conveyed, like electricity, throughout the entire meeting, when the huzzas of the people surpassed anything we ever witnessed. The cattle were instantly liberated and given up to Mr. Germain.… Thus terminated this extraordinary contest between the Church and the people, the latter having obtained, by their steadiness, a complete victory. The cattle will be given to the poor of the sundry districts.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Similar scenes were reported elsewhere:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Some cows seized for tithes were brought to a public place for sale, escorted by a squadron of lancers, and followed by thousands of infuriated people. All the garrison, cavalry and infantry, under the command of Sir George Bingham, were called out. The cattle were set up at three pounds for each, no bidder; two pounds, no bidder; one pound, no bidder; in short, the auctioneer descended to three shillings for each cow, but no purchaser appeared. This scene lasted for above an hour, when there being no chance of making sale of the cattle, it was proposed to adjourn the auction; but, as we are informed, the General in command of the military expressed an unwillingness to have the troops subjected to a repetition of the harassing duty thus imposed on them. After a short delay, it was, at the interference and remonstrance of several gentlemen, both of town and country, agreed upon that the cattle should be given up to the people, subject to certain private arrangements. We never witnessed such a scene; thousands of country people jumping with exulted feelings at the result, wielding their shillelaghs, and exhibiting all the other symptoms of exuberant joy characteristic of the buoyancy of Irish feeling.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At Carlow… Some cattle had been seized for tithe, and a public sale announced, when a large body of men, stated at 50,000, marched to the place appointed, and, of course, under the influence of such terror, none were found to bid for the cattle.

His duty is to speak to the Government on behalf of the village, not to oppress his brethren by attaching their property in order to recover an unjust tax.

I humbly request you to find out some means of getting out of the odious task of oppressing the people, when your time to retire is now so near. Rather than take the next step of forfeiting the lands of the agriculturists, I would suggest to you to resign. I dare say you have sufficient days of privilege leave yet unenjoyed. As your well-wisher I would ask you to go on leave prior to retirement rather than stain your honour by doing things which do not become you.\n\nAs a result of pressure like this, “the officials who every day talked of crushing the movement… could not get local men or local labourers for the purpose, and had to go as far as Bombay to hire the service of the Pathans.”\n\n## Free Keene\n\nA group of activists in Keene, New Hampshire, ranging from Christian anarchists to “Free State Project” ballot-box libertarians, has been experimenting with innovative civil disobedience projects in recent years.\n\nIn one example, in 2006 Russell Kanning went to the Keene branch of the IRS and tried to hand leaflets to the employees there.\nThe leaflets quoted from the tribunal that presided over war crimes trials in Japan after World War II, to the effect that people are personally obligated to disengage from the crimes of their governments.\nIncluded in the leaflets was a sample letter that IRS employees could send if they wanted to resign from their jobs.\n\nKanning was arrested by agents from the Department of Homeland Security and charged with distributing materials in a federal building and failure to obey a lawful order.\nAfter he was booked and released, he immediately returned to the IRS office to try again (without the leaflets, which had been confiscated). He was arrested again and charged with disorderly conduct.\n\nA few months later, Dave Ridley followed-up on Kanning’s action, this time at the Nashua IRS office.\nHe silently held up a sign that read “Is it right to work for the IRS?” and passed a leaflet through the window that read in part:\n\n> I have the right to remain silent.

They then turned him on his face upon the bed; and taking a lively ram cat out of a bag which they brought with them, they set the cat between the proctor’s shoulders. The beast, being nearly as much terrified as the proctor, would endeavour to get off; but being held fast by the tail, he intrenched every claw deep in the proctor’s back, in order to keep up a firm resistance to the White Boys. The more the tail was pulled back, the more the ram cat tried to go forward; at length, when he had, as he conceived, made his possession quite secure, main force convinced him to the contrary, and that if he kept his hold, he must lose his tail. So, he was dragged backward to the proctor’s loins, grappling at every pull, and bringing away, here and there, strips of the proctor’s skin, to prove the pertinacity of his defence. When the ram cat had got down to the loins, he was once more placed at the shoulders, and again \u003Cem>carded\u003C/em> the proctor (\u003Ci>toties quoties\u003C/i>) according to his sentence.\n\n## A Tithe Auction in Wales\n\nIn 1891, an auctioneer who was selling off a farmer’s produce to pay his refused tithes was met with a crowd who were determined that he have a bad day:\n\n> They were armed with eggs of a veteran vintage, and with these they began bombarding the auctioneer and chief constable. Those parties were soon plastered with the odorous stuff, but tried to drive away the crowd by threats of prosecution. This enraged the people more and they set fire to the furze, and seized the auctioneer and tried to duck him in an adjoining pond. He pleaded and promised to give up tithe sales, if they would let him go, which they did.\n\n## LaSaunders Hudson\n\nIn 1972, when state revenue agents tried to collect $197 in back taxes from LaSaunders Hudson at his dry cleaning business in Memphis, Tennessee, Hudson pulled out a gun and told them “to strip to the buff and march out of his store, much to the astonishment of the passersby in predominantly black Park Street.”\n\n> “A crowd of people had already gathered on the street and they cheered and clapped when we walked out,” [agent John Mabile] said.…\n>\n> Mabile said as the agents were removing their underwear, Hudson advised them that “this is part of the punishment we are going to give the white man for injustices done the black man.”\n\n## Gabelle Riots\n\nDuring the salt tax (\u003Ci>gabelle\u003C/i>) riots in Bordeaux in 1548, some tax collectors were killed, and to make sure the point was well-understood: “Their bodies were dragged through the streets and covered in heaps of salt.”\n\n## Canadian Irish\n\nIn 1881, a deputy sheriff tried to seize property from Irish settlers in Canada who were refusing to pay a county tax.\nInstead, the settlers “compelled him to eat the writs he had, and then gave him a limited time to get out of the township.”\n\n## Humiliation in Absentia\n\nSome humiliation attacks might be inflicted on the tax collector in absentia or in effigy.\nDuring the Tithe War in Ireland, resisters\n\n> …audaciously dug a grave within sight of Dinefwr Castle, the family seat, and announced that [Colonel George Rice] Trevor would occupy it by 10 October. Trevor, however, surrounded by soldiers, survived unscathed.\n\nAnd during the Whiskey Rebellion,\n\n> [T]he inspector of the revenue was burnt in effigy in Allegany county, at a place, and on a day, of some public election, with much display, and without interruption, in the presence of magistrates and other public officers.\n\n## The Tax Collectors’ Chair\n\nWhen a tax professional took a tour of the Ashton Villa in Galveston, Texas, he learned about an interesting tax avoidance tactic from bygone days:\n\n> When you walk into the house you are greeted by the typical fare—a somewhat nice looking staircase, a chandelier, older looking pictures, etc. What is most interesting is the calling card basket and the chair that sits nearby.\n>\n> …The chair is the only real piece of furniture in the room. The chair is made of a beautiful polished wood. It has a nice dark brown stain. But there are some peculiarities about the chair. The seat of the chair has a sharp raised crevice running through the middle in the most obscene manner and the backrest is bent outward in the most unergonomic way. Further, the chair has only one small armrest. The whole contraption is polished and it slants forward at a steep angle. It is a very odd-looking piece of furniture.\n>\n> I could not resist asking the tour guide why anyone would have such a contraption in his or her home. Could the original inhabitants not afford proper furniture? The tour guide explained that, given the calling card system, the only person who would show up without an appointment would be the tax collector. So the tax collector would be offered a seat in the chair and would be left waiting for several hours. The hope was that the tax collector would simply go away. So the chair was a tax savings measure—a tax savings measure that, according to the tour guide, was widely used in wealthy Southern homes before the turn of the last century.\n\n## Non-Violent Humiliation\n\nAs that example shows, humiliation doesn’t have to include violence or the threat of violence to be effective.\nMockery is also a nonviolent but humiliating deterrent.\nTax collectors in Bardoli were stymied by villagers who would sound the alarm whenever they approached, so that when they arrived in town “women stood in front of locked doors laughing at them.”\n\nAnother amusing example comes from the tithe resistance campaign in Coventry in 1892:\n\n> The quarrel was attended by a good many fights and some funny episodes as when a farmer, living in the suburbs, upon whose stock it was proposed to levy, greased all his pigs, so that they slipped through the hands of the bailiffs at every attempt, much to the delight of a crowd that witnessed the spectacle.

having done which, they bound him naked to a tree, and left him in that situation till morning, when he succeeded in extricating himself. Not content with this, the malcontents some days after made him another visit, pulled down part of his house, and put him in a situation to be obliged to become an exile from his home, and to find an asylum elsewhere.\n\n## Rebecca Riots\n\nDuring the Rebecca Riots,\n\n> …the dead body of Thomas Thomas… was found in a river near Brechfa! This man had been very much opposed to the Rebecca movement, and… had been to Carmarthen to make a complaint to the authorities against some Rebeccaites; on his return home that night he found his house, etc., on fire. Bearing this in mind, together with other circumstantial evidence, it is plain that he had some bitter enemies in the neighbourhood, and it was generally believed that he had been waylaid and murdered.\n\nThomas had on another occasion testified against his servant and had him jailed, and for this the Rebeccaites had ransacked his house, destroying what they could.\n\n## Tithe War\n\nDuring the Tithe War in Ireland, resisters prevented people from cooperating with attempts to seize and auction off resisters’ goods:\n\n> [T]he assembled spectators were afraid to bid, lest they should incur the vengeance of the peasantry… Not one man in a hundred had the hardihood to declare himself the purchaser.\n\nIn order to take his tithes “in kind” from the farmers in his parish, one clergyman had to import some sixty workers “from distant counties, and at high wages, who yet were incapable of obtaining more than a small portion of tithes, being interrupted by a rabble—chiefly women—though men were lurking in the background to support them.”\n\n## Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nDuring the Bardoli tax strike, anyone from outside the district who came to purchase land that the government had seized for non-payment was told in no uncertain terms that they might buy the land, but they would have to get their labor, goods, and services somewhere else: “they might have lands just for the fun of it, but not to cultivate.”\n\n## Stamp Act Resistance\n\nIn colonial North Carolina during the Stamp Act agitation, “stamp masters were seized and forced to swear they would have nothing to do with the stamps.”\nWhen the rebels learned of the arrival of a ship bearing the stamps, they called out a 700-person strong militia, “seized the vessel, and held her until her commander promised not to permit the stamps to be taken from her.”\n\n## Reform Act Agitation\n\nDuring the Reform Act uprising in the 1830s,\n\n> Threats had been employed to prevent auctioneers from selling distrained goods; and an auctioneer in Bath had been obliged, in consequence of intimidation, to issue a handbill, in which he gave public notice, that he would not receive for sale any goods distrained for the non-payment of King’s Taxes.\n\n## Household Tax Resistance\n\nIrish Household Tax resisters mobbed Ireland’s Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, surrounding his car and chanting “fucking scumbag.”\nAnother politician who witnessed the event said:\n“In my view, there was an element of thuggery to it. Some of the protestors prevented him from getting out of the car park.”\n\n## Tax Resistance in Spain\n\nWhen the municipality of Ondárroa tried to hire an outside debt collection company—Gesmunpal—to go after resisters, “the nationalist left spread slogans via Internet in favor of ‘civil disobedience,’ as well as calls and letters against the company.\nGesmunpal resigned.”\n\n## Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nPoll tax resisters in Thatcher’s Britain threatened tax system collaborators, for example:\n\n> Attacks and threats have been made against Bristol newsagents and shops where people can pay the Poll Tax. Windows have been smashed and graffiti daubed over businesses which have become agents for the Bristol-based company “Penalty Points.” The firm installs special tills with its agents to collect the community charge on behalf of local authorities for a fee. Mr. Ross Hendry, a spokesman for the company… said “because of the attacks, one newsagent in Patchway has now declined taking an agency after a brick was thrown through his window.” He said another newsagent in Bishoport Avenue, Hartclife had the words “Poll Tax scab” and “you’re the first” scrawled in white paint across his window. A Circle K store in Cardiff where the revolutionary scheme was launched on April 9th with 48 agents, had its door locks jammed with superglue.\n\n![](../../../assets/bailiffs-beware.gif)\n\nIntimidation of bailiffs (people authorized to seize and sell property for tax arrears) was widespread:\n\n> Housing schemes and estates were plastered with posters. One showing a vicious dog, read “Bailiffs? Make my day!” Another showing a picture of Malcolm X holding a machine gun looking out from behind the curtains, read: “Bailiffs we’re ready.” A third showed a picture of a bailiff swinging in a noose. It read “Dead bailiffs don’t knock on doors.” In some areas bailiffs and registration officers were photographed and their portraits were reproduced on posters which read “wanted” and listed their “crimes.” These images were extremely popular… People were used to seeing images of themselves in the role of victim. Now wherever they looked there were images of their adversaries in this role.…\n>\n> Wherever the council registration officers went they were harassed. In Glasgow violent threats drove canvasser Robert Stevenson to quit his job. He was physically threatened twice in four weeks and continually harassed:\n>\n> > I’d just put the form through the door when this guy across in the garden opposite started shouting. He was sitting in the garden with about four others and they were all giving me dirty looks. He said that if I came back to collect the form I would need a tank for protection. I was in no doubt that they were serious. I didn’t finish my last street. I just chucked it.\n>\n> …another canvasser… was “harassed by a gang.” In this case, it was reported that:\n>\n> > Four or five youths cornered him in a close in Gairbraid Avenue and subjected him to abuse. A Strathclyde police spokesman revealed: “They said it was a ‘No Poll Tax Area’ and told the worker to get out, which he did.”\n>\n> Following these reports, the Poll Tax registration officer admitted that ‘there had been at least four other incidents involving canvassers’ and… canvassers had been threatened (leaflets were grabbed from their hands). Already over two members of his staff had resigned because of fears about their personal safety.…\n>\n> Mr. Trueman, a Poll Tax snooper whose job was to call on people and badger them into filling the registration forms, [was] unable to cope with the abuse…\n>\n> > Mrs. Trueman found the corpse of her husband as she came back from shopping. Fred Trueman, 52, an employee of Bristol City, had hanged himself. “No-one can imagine what terrible pressure he had to work under,” she claimed. “He was sworn at and threatened; he couldn’t stand it any more.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Davis, W.W.H. \u003Ci>The Fries Rebellion\u003C/i> (1899), p. 45\n* Hamilton, Alexander “Report on Opposition to Internal Duties” (5 August 1794) \u003Ci>The Works of Alexander Hamilton\u003C/i>, Vol. IV (1851), pp. 120–34\n* Evans, Henry Tobit \u003Ci>Rebecca Riots!\u003C/i> (2010 ed.), p. 17\n* Fitzpatrick, William John \u003Ci>The Life, Times, and Correspondence of the Right Rev.

We no longer have the facilities, we don’t have the IT infrastructure in place to support them, we don’t have the people, and some would argue that we are beginning to lose the expertise.\n\n## American War Tax Resisters\n\nThe IRS has tried to crack down on people who send them paperwork just to waste their time.\nThey have come up with something they call the “frivolous filing penalty” and they can ding filers for $5,000 each time they file any sort of paperwork that takes a position the agency considers to be “frivolous.”\nThe agency can assess this penalty immediately and on the whim of whichever bureaucrat is handling the case, without going to court, and the victim is only allowed to appeal the fine before a judge if he or she pays it first!\n\nWar tax resister Karl Meyer wasn’t about to let the IRS think it could intimidate him that way.\nSo in 1984, at the height of the “Cabbage Patch Kids” craze (each doll slightly different), he invented what he called “cabbage patch resistance”—filing a different, blatantly “frivolous” tax return \u003Cem>every day\u003C/em>, “addressed to a different employee or office of the IRS.”\nHe was assessed $140,000 in penalties in 1984 alone (though the penalty per frivolous return was only $500 back then).\nThe IRS never has collected that money. The best it could manage was to seize and sell Meyer’s car, for a little over $1,000.\n\nWar tax resister Ed Hedemann has already made plans for what he calls “zombie war tax resistance.”\nHe has filled in years of tax returns ahead of time and put them in pre-stamped envelopes so that his survivors can continue to file (but, of course, refuse to pay!) after he’s dead and gone.\n“Why give the government a break from having to deal with your resistance when you die?” he asks.\n\nHedemann also makes a point of periodically filing Freedom of Information Act requests for any information the IRS and other government agencies have been collecting about his activities—hundreds of pages, as it turns out—and he’s put together a guide for other tax resisters to follow in making their own requests.\n\n## American Constitutionalists\n\n“Constitutionalist” and “sovereign citizen”-style tax protest groups in the United States are fond of harassing tax officials and other government employees with lawsuits, liens, bogus quasi-official court filings, and other such paperwork.\nIn one example, Eddie Kahn’s “Guiding Light of God Ministries” filed some 2,000 misconduct complaints against IRS agents.\nA newspaper article about a subsequent legal case against the group noted that:\n\n> Some agents have said that their supervisors ordered them to back off from audits or collection efforts in the face of [such] threats, just to avoid investigations by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration.\n\n## Hacking the Tax Agency\n\nOther paperwork tricks are more like “hacking” in that they treat the tax agency as a system that processes input and produces output, and note that certain examples of pathological input can result in output that was not anticipated by the system designers.\nFor example, the IRS mistakenly gave away twenty million dollars in the 2008 filing season when crafty people figured out that if they substantially \u003Cem>overpaid\u003C/em> their taxes with a bad check, the IRS would cut them a hefty refund check before they noticed they’d been had.\n\nThere is an ongoing epidemic of “identity theft” tax fraud in the United States in which the fraudsters file for phony tax refunds in the names of other, real people.\nThis often causes the tax collection bureaucracy to swing into action against the \u003Cem>victims\u003C/em> of the identity theft—once the IRS figures out it’s been swindled—which is both a waste of resources and a way of further alienating the population from the government and its tax agency.\n\n## Alliance of the Libertarian Left\n\nSouth Carolina’s state government passed a law that required all organizations that “directly or indirectly advocate, advise, teach, or practice the duty or necessity of controlling, seizing, or overthrowing the government of the United States, the state of South Carolina, or any political division thereof,” to register their activities with the South Carolina Secretary of State and to pay a five-dollar filing fee.\nA member of the Alliance of the Libertarian Left decided to register, but with a twist:\n\n> When belligerence and inhumanity prevail, the peaceful and the humane must find honor in being categorized as the enemies of the prevailing order. Please keep me updated as to the status of our registration. I look forward to hearing back from you as to our official recognition as enemies of your state and its government.…\n>\n> P.S. I am told that there is a processing fee in the amount of $5.00 for the registration of a subversive organization. Our organization is in fact so dastardly that we have refused to remit the fee.\n\n## Prussian Farmers\n\nPrussian farmers in 1922 used the bureaucracy against itself.\nA \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> report noted:\n\n> They have all filed protests and demanded that they be relieved from paying the tax until the protests are settled. That means a delay of at least three years in collecting the taxes, and it is said that the Provincial Treasury is inclined to grant this request.

The best it could manage was to seize and sell Meyer’s car, for a little over $1,000.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>War tax resister Ed Hedemann has already made plans for what he calls “zombie war tax resistance.”\nHe has filled in years of tax returns ahead of time and put them in pre-stamped envelopes so that his survivors can continue to file (but, of course, refuse to pay!) after he’s dead and gone.\n“Why give the government a break from having to deal with your resistance when you die?” he asks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hedemann also makes a point of periodically filing Freedom of Information Act requests for any information the IRS and other government agencies have been collecting about his activities—hundreds of pages, as it turns out—and he’s put together a guide for other tax resisters to follow in making their own requests.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"american-constitutionalists\">American Constitutionalists\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>“Constitutionalist” and “sovereign citizen”-style tax protest groups in the United States are fond of harassing tax officials and other government employees with lawsuits, liens, bogus quasi-official court filings, and other such paperwork.\nIn one example, Eddie Kahn’s “Guiding Light of God Ministries” filed some 2,000 misconduct complaints against IRS agents.\nA newspaper article about a subsequent legal case against the group noted that:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Some agents have said that their supervisors ordered them to back off from audits or collection efforts in the face of [such] threats, just to avoid investigations by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"hacking-the-tax-agency\">Hacking the Tax Agency\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Other paperwork tricks are more like “hacking” in that they treat the tax agency as a system that processes input and produces output, and note that certain examples of pathological input can result in output that was not anticipated by the system designers.\nFor example, the IRS mistakenly gave away twenty million dollars in the 2008 filing season when crafty people figured out that if they substantially \u003Cem>overpaid\u003C/em> their taxes with a bad check, the IRS would cut them a hefty refund check before they noticed they’d been had.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is an ongoing epidemic of “identity theft” tax fraud in the United States in which the fraudsters file for phony tax refunds in the names of other, real people.\nThis often causes the tax collection bureaucracy to swing into action against the \u003Cem>victims\u003C/em> of the identity theft—once the IRS figures out it’s been swindled—which is both a waste of resources and a way of further alienating the population from the government and its tax agency.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"alliance-of-the-libertarian-left\">Alliance of the Libertarian Left\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>South Carolina’s state government passed a law that required all organizations that “directly or indirectly advocate, advise, teach, or practice the duty or necessity of controlling, seizing, or overthrowing the government of the United States, the state of South Carolina, or any political division thereof,” to register their activities with the South Carolina Secretary of State and to pay a five-dollar filing fee.\nA member of the Alliance of the Libertarian Left decided to register, but with a twist:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>When belligerence and inhumanity prevail, the peaceful and the humane must find honor in being categorized as the enemies of the prevailing order.

tax resisters is to say “if you won’t pay taxes ‘voluntarily,’ we’ll seize your property instead.”\n\nSome tax resisters have responded to this by taunting back: “you’ll have to find it first.”\nOne way they have made good on this is by arranging for other people to hold the resisters’ property in their names.\n\nFor example, some war tax resistance “alternative funds,” into which resisters pay their taxes rather than submitting them to the government, have a dual purpose: they redirect tax money to causes the resisters find more palatable than government expenses (see redirect resisted taxes to charity), and they form a fund that, although it is not officially in their names, resisters can later reclaim if the government succeeds in seizing taxes from them.\n\n## Ammon Hennacy\n\nThe tax collector was so frustrated in trying to seize anything at all from tax resister Ammon Hennacy that, when Hennacy was picketing the IRS office one day, the agent assigned to his case walked up to him and seized his picket sign—telling him he planned to auction it off!\nThe next day, Hennacy was picketing again with some new signs that he and a friend had hastily made the night before… each one carefully marked “this sign is the personal property of Joseph Craigmyle.”\n\n## The Tithe War\n\nIn the Irish Tithe War, sympathetic farmers would give temporary pasturage to

A search was, of course, instituted, and often days were consumed in prosecuting it.\n\n## American Quakers\n\nIn 1983 the Friends General Conference put an ad in the Friends Journal that encouraged Quakers to give interest-free loans to the Conference as a way to “reduce their income taxes while retaining financial security for themselves and their families.”\nIn essence: the Conference would collect any interest on the funds as a donation, and in return it would hold the donor’s assets in a way that was non-reportable to the IRS, while being willing to return the principal to the donor on 30-days’ notice.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Hennacy, Ammon “My First Fast and Picketing” \u003Ci>We Won’t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader\u003C/i> (2008) p. 385\n* Fitzpatrick, William John \u003Ci>The Life, Times, and Correspondence of the Right Rev.

The tax inspector is in town.”\n>\n> There was a rumbling sound as the steel curtains with which French shops are shuttered at night were rolled down all over St. Cere.…\n>\n> The tax inspector rapped on steel curtain after steel curtain, demanding to be let in to see the books.

Poujade was suddenly a national figure and he lost no time in organizing his Union to spread the message of the loudspeakers and the steel curtains.\n\nIn addition, according to another article on the movement, “some priests ring church bells to warn of the arrival of the revenuers.”\n\n## Greek “Won’t Pay” Movement\n\nWhen tax official Nikos Maitos took a team of inspectors to the island of Naxos to hunt for tax evaders, “a local radio station broadcast his license plate number to warn residents.”\n\n## Beidenfleth Resistance\n\nA tax strike broke out in rural Germany between the world wars.\nWhen tax collectors were spotted coming to distrain cattle from the resisters, resisters “blew the fire horn, and on the road they lit a fire of straw, the age-old sign that help is needed.\nPeasants ran from all sides towards the smoke.”\n\n## Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nDuring the Bardoli satyagraha, tax collectors and other government enforcers were shadowed by the resisters, who warned villagers they were coming.\nResister Govardhandas Chokhavala said, “We have provided our volunteers with drums and conches, and the moment they sight a Government servant, the drum or the conch gives the alarm.\nThat is work which is after the heart of these youngsters.”\nSome other notes from \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i> read:\n\n> [E]very village had its volunteers ready with their bugles or drums which were pressed into aid as soon as they caught sight of the Talati and Patel out on their \u003Ci>japti\u003C/i> [attachment] depredations.\n\n> The youngsters on duty announced [the Collector’s] arrival by a hearty beating of their drums. and all the doors were closed.\n\n> Some [resisters] had to post themselves at and keep a strict watch over the various approaches to the village, and no sooner was a japti party sighted or the whank of a car heard, than they were to be on their alert, and the warning of the fact to be given to the village people. Some of them had always like sleuth hounds to be on the trail of the Government officials. Their business was to scent their plans and warn the village people against their machinations.\n\nThe government found this tactic so frustrating that at one point it “prohibited the beating of drums, playing music, or blowing conches or horns on or near public roads or public places or Government buildings.”\nSome boys were arrested, tried, and imprisoned for nothing more than keeping a watchful eye on a government building from across the street.\n\n## Meo Rebellion\n\nTax resisters in Alwar, India in 1932 used this system:\n“The paths are blocked by huge boulders and at intervals along the hills remote from the towns are watchers with giant tom-toms which are heard for five miles, giving warning of the approach of troops or the revenue collectors.”\n\n## Rebecca Riots\n\nThe horn became a symbol of the Rebeccaite uprising in Wales because of incidents like this one:\n\n> The constables then went towards Talog; but when on their way there they heard the sound of a horn, and immediately between two and three hundred persons assembled together, with their faces blackened, some dressed in women’s caps, and others with their coats turned so as to be completely disguised—armed with scythes, crowbars and all manner of destructive weapons which they could lay their hands on. After cheering the constables, they defied them to do their duty. The latter had no alternative but to return to town without executing their warrants.\n>\n> The women were seen running in all directions to alarm their neighbours; and some hundreds were concealed behind the hedges, intending to appear if their services were required. The entire district seemed to be aroused, and awaiting the arrival of the constables, who were going to levy on the goods of John Harris of Talog Mill for the amount of the fine and costs imposed upon him by the magistrates. There could not have been less than two hundred persons assembled to resist the execution of process, and vast numbers were flocking from all quarters, in response to the blowing of a horn, the signal of the Rebeccaites to repair thither. Various mounted messengers were scouring the country and sounding the trumpet of alarm.\n\n## Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nDuring the poll tax rebellion in Thatcher’s Britain, resisters tracked and shadowed bailiffs, and declared certain areas to be bailiff “no-go” zones, establishing look-outs to raise the alarm if any bailiffs dared to approach.\nThe campaign modeled this approach on tactics used in South African townships during the anti-apartheid resistance there, and then customized the tactic for their local conditions:\n\n> Throughout Britain, city-wide bailiff busting groups were formed. Activists in Edinburgh formed a group called “Scum-busters” which was equipped with CB radios and squadrons of cars. Telephone trees were organised; bailiff companies were monitored; their car registration numbers were taken and distributed to activists in all the local areas. Camden, in London, followed their example in 1991:\n>\n> > We have organised a rota so that we know who and when people are available to do whatever shift. We have organised a “knock up system” giving people different responsibilities for knocking up each part of the estate when the bailiffs are spotted. Telephone trees have also been established. We have approached a couple of mini-cab firms who have agreed to be bailiff spotters.…\n\n## Dublin Water Charge Strike\n\nAn activist in the Dublin water charge strike remembered what happened when the government threatened to cut off water services to resisters in December, 1994:\n\n> All the activists raced into action. There were stake-outs at the water inspectors’ houses. We would follow them around to ensure that they didn’t attempt any cut off under the cover of the night. Clondalkin people organised their own cars to patrol around that area. CB radios were installed in the cars so that we were in constant communication with each other as we monitored the movements of the men who would try to cut people’s water off. One house in Tallaght was turned into a virtual Head Quarters for the campaign. The phone calls kept flooding in. Communities learned to be vigilant of the blue Dublin Water Works vans and were very wary when they came into the estates. Children playing football on the park were told to knock on the doors when they saw such vans in the area. Indeed one van ventured into an estate in Clondalkin village and when the kids alerted everyone to their presence they hopped back into their van and drove away rapidly!\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* “The Passive Resistance of Edinburgh, to the Clergy-Tax” \u003Ci>Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine\u003C/i>, September 1833, p. 795 (note)\n* Clausen, Oliver “The Revolt of Monsieur Poujade” \u003Ci>The Montreal Gazette\u003C/i> 27 June 1955, p. 8\n* “Tax Dodgers’ Revolt” \u003Ci>Life\u003C/i> 18 April 1955, p. 63\n* Alderman, Liz “Greece Warns of Going Broke as Tax Proceeds Dry Up” \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> 5 June 2012\n* von Salomon, Ernst \u003Ci>Fragebogen\u003C/i> (English translation, Doubleday, 1955) p. 134\n* Desai, Mahadev \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i> (1929) pp. 71, 95, 112, 125, 164, 187–9\n* “Tax Revolt: Peasant Rising in Indian State” \u003Ci>The Canberra Times\u003C/i> 30 November 1932, p. 1\n* Evans, Henry Tobit \u003Ci>Rebecca Riots!\u003C/i> (2010 ed.), p. 45, 152–53 (quoting Josie Alvarez from the All-Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation newsletter, September 1990)\n* “Winning the Water War” \u003Ci>Anarchist News\u003C/i> #23, April 2000\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/docs/tacticsthatfrustratecountermeasures/warnpeopleoftaxcollectors.md","314d247c43c37c61",{"html":1411,"metadata":1412},"\u003Cp>These days, taxes and tax assessments are often administered in an impersonal way.\nFaraway bureaucrats shuffle numbers in spreadsheets.\nComputers send letters.\nBut tax collectors and assessors have sometimes had to scrape some shoe leather to get the job done, and this has been another opportunity for the resisters.\nOne way tax resisters can foil the plans of the tax collectors is to send up the alarm when they’re on the way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"annuity-tax-resistance\">Annuity Tax Resistance\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>“Horning” was a legal term describing the process under which tax debtors could be imprisoned for defying the King (it was normally prohibited at the time to imprison someone merely for being a debtor in default).\nDuring the Edinburgh Annuity Tax resistance, one victim of this process declared “Horning! horning!—by the powers! if they bring a \u003Cem>horning\u003C/em> against me, I’ll bring a horning against them”:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>When the King’s messenger-at-arms, as tipstaves are called in Scotland, brought his \u003Cem>horning\u003C/em> to the Cowgate, the Irishman, previously provided with a tremendous bullock’s horn, blew a blast “so loud and dread,” that it might have brought down the Castle wall; and a \u003Cem>faction\u003C/em> mustered as quickly as if it had sounded in the suburbs of Kilkenny.

Greene, and Benjamin Tucker challenged the government monopoly on currency as part of their critiques of coercive government.\n   Warren’s “labor notes” are one early 19th century ancestor of the “Time Dollars” that are currently in use in some areas of the United States (see below).\n1. **privacy / secrecy**\u003Cbr />\n   If you can remove yourself from the government’s money system, perhaps you can keep the government from finding out about your earnings and spending altogether—and can thereby make these activities more difficult to tax.\n   So much of the early cyberpunk sci-fi took for granted a future in which anonymous, encrypted micro-payments were going to be flying through the wires faster than any government could track them.\n   (The founders of PayPal were in fact hoping to turn this sci-fi dream into reality and, for a while, they fully intended their service to empower people and disempower governments.)\n\n   John T. Kennedy, writing of what he called “economic secession,” put it this way:\n   “Think of how much less profitable taxation would be if government didn’t know how much money you earned or how much money you had.\n   The Leviathan cannot extract the revenue necessary to sustain itself at anything like current levels without knowing where the money is.…\n   if the means of economic privacy are available [people] must choose between keeping their own money in their own pockets or voluntarily turning it over to government.\n   Then you’ll see economic secession on a grand scale.”\n\nHere are some examples of how people have used alternative currencies to facilitate or augment tax resistance:\n\n## Time Dollars\n\nThe state of Missouri experimented with issuing what it called “Time Dollars” to people who volunteered to spend their time helping the elderly.\nThese volunteers could in turn use their Time Dollars to hire similar help if they needed it later on.\nThe state promised that it would honor these Time Dollars itself if no home care workers were available who would accept such currency.\nAlthough Missouri did not have a tax resistance motive in establishing this program, in 1985 they sought (and eventually obtained) an IRS ruling that Time Dollars did not represent taxable income.\n\nMany alternative currency projects in the United States are trying to follow the Time Dollar model, in some cases with the explicit goal of helping tax resisters.\n\n## Norraths, Britannian gold pieces, & QQ coins\n\nThe currencies that are used in massively-multiplayer online (MMO) games are also plausible challengers to legal tender.\n\nIf you’ve never played one of these games, you may be surprised at just how huge they have become, and just how many transactions take place in these fantasy currencies.\nAnd because players can sell their hard-won game-world belongings on real-world auction sites like eBay, it has become possible to exchange virtual money for real goods, real money for virtual goods, or virtual money for real money.\nIn 2001, an economist took the time to figure out what the exchange rate was between EverQuest Norraths and U.S. Dollars, and he concluded:\n\n> [EverQuest has] the 77th largest economy in the world. [It] has a gross national product per capita of $2,266, making its economy larger than either the Chinese or Indian economy and roughly comparable to Russia’s economy.…\n>\n> The nominal hourly wage is about $3.42 per hour, and the labors of the people produce a GNP per capita somewhere between that of Russia and Bulgaria. A unit of Norrath’s currency is traded on exchange markets at $0.0107, higher than the yen and the lira. The economy is characterized by extreme inequality, yet life there is quite attractive to many.\n\nNote that when he says that EverQuest had the 77th largest economy in the world, he means the \u003Cem>real\u003C/em> world, not just the virtual world.\nTax agencies do not yet tax this thriving economy, though most of its transactions are (in theory at least) easily-traceable.\nJulian Dibbell wondered why the tax collector hasn’t come calling yet:\n\n> If you haven’t misspent hours battling an Arctic Ogre Lord near an Ice Dungeon or been equally profligate spending time reading the published works of the Internal Revenue Service, you probably haven’t wondered whether the United States government will someday tax your virtual winnings from games played over the Internet. The real question is: Why hasn’t it happened already?\n>\n> …if you look on online marketplaces like eBay today, you will find a thriving, multimillion-dollar market in Golden Runic Hammers, Ethereal Mounts, and similarly exotic items—all of them won (and anything found or wrested from another player is “won” in the context of a game) or bartered for in this or that MMO quest, and many of them fetching prices in the hundreds, even thousands of dollars.\n\nDibbell then tried to figure out how he \u003Cem>would\u003C/em> declare income earned in the course of the game if he were to decide to.\nHe turned to an IRS instruction guide, which he found to include sections on “every conceivable form of income known to accounting”:\n\n> To read it once is to realize that you know nothing about income. Here you’ll find a description of gains, ill-gotten and otherwise, so irregular that they can be taxed only according to that form of guesswork known as fair market value. Here are stocks, options, retirement watches, and stolen goods (“If you steal property, you must report its fair market value in your income in the year you steal it unless in the same year, you return it to its rightful owner”).\n\nHe determined that “items acquired either through barter or as prizes in a game” is the closest category.\nBut then it got tricky:\n\n> Goods taken in trade or won at play are taxable the moment they fall into somebody’s hands, even if they are not sold for money. The more I read, the more I wondered whether reporting the amount I had brought home from selling virtual items on eBay was enough to satisfy the IRS.\n>\n> What about the assets I bartered for or won in the game but never sold in the real world, the suits of armor stashed here and there with their easily established fair market value? What if I traded those assets for their value in Ultima Online’s official currency, the Britannian gold piece, rather than for dollars? Wouldn’t it be easy to establish their value in dollars nonetheless and, if I owed American taxes on the exchange, put a number on the deal that the IRS could grasp and love? And what about all the other MMO players out there—how long could the IRS be expected in good conscience to leave the resulting millions of dollars in wealth untouched?\n\nHilarious!\nImagine opening the treasure chest behind the dragon you just dispatched in a video game, only to find that it was one-third empty thanks to income tax withholding!\nIs the armor that your character bought a business expense, and if so, how should you handle depreciation?\nCan you imagine?\n\nBut the government has two choices: either enlist an army of IRS accountants and lawyers to come up with just this sort of absurd regulation, or allow a huge virtual economy, at which many of its citizens fruitfully labor for hours and hours, to go untaxed… and potentially to spill out into the real-world economy.\n\nHere’s another example:\nA silly on-line currency called the “QQ coin” became a craze in China, and exposed a latent demand for an alternative to the tightly-controlled legal tender there.\n\n> In some rural areas, where debit and credit cards are scarce, stores began to accept QQ coins as payment for real goods and services.…\n>\n> “QQ coins were being traded with such volume and frequency that they did start to drag down the value of the \u003Ci>yuan\u003C/i>,” one financial analyst told the \u003Ci>Wall Street Journal\u003C/i>. In other words, demand was so great that QQ coins began to have more buying power than genuine Chinese banknotes.…\n>\n> The growing impact of QQ coins was also enough to worry top government ministries in China, including the central bank, which announced it was “on the lookout for any assault by such virtual currencies on the real economic and financial order.”\n\n> The coins have also become the medium of exchange for online gambling and money laundering, said an executive of another online game operator.\n>\n> “Once the money becomes QQ coins, it can be transferred anywhere electronically,” he said.…\n>\n> Online auction sites… are part of the problem as they allow users quick and easy exchange of QQ coins back to real money.\n>\n> More than 100,000 auctions of discounted QQ coins happen on Taobao each day, according to mainland media, with transaction volume reaching an annual 200 million \u003Ci>yuan\u003C/i>.\n\n## Honor Bonds\n\nFor a time in the United States, you could go to a bank and buy an “honor bond” (or “bearer bond”) for the face value of your purchase.\nSuch bonds were anonymous—anyone could redeem them, not just the person to whom they were issued.\nAnd they earned interest.\nSo for a certain class of savvy people, tax resisters in particular, they were better than money for conducting high-denomination transactions.\nThe government has since cracked down on the practice.\n\n## Liberty Dollars\n\nThe U.S. government also tightened the screws on a fellow who started coining a parallel currency called the “Liberty Dollar” that he hoped would be more reliable and valuable than the stuff they print out at the Mint—but not before some sixty million dollars worth of the currency were in circulation.\nThe government felt so threatened by this competitor that it convicted him of criminal charges in 2011 and confiscated the precious metal that his organization was using to mint its coins and to back its paper currency, on the grounds that the Liberty Dollar project amounted to money laundering, mail fraud, wire fraud, counterfeiting, and conspiracy.\n\nThe federal prosecutor in charge of the case said, after winning the conviction:\n“Attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism.\nWhile these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence, they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of this country.\nWe are determined to meet these threats through infiltration, disruption, and dismantling of organizations which seek to challenge the legitimacy of our democratic form of government.”\n\n## Tems\n\nIn modern Greece, people turned with creativity born of desperation to a variety of alternative economic tactics, including the use of an alternative currency called “\u003Ci>tems\u003C/i>” that the Greek government has not yet figured out how to tax.\n\nPeople can join the \u003Ci>tems\u003C/i> network and immediately start paying for goods and services by using a web-based interface to transfer some amount of this internet-based currency.\nThis puts them into debt by however much they transfer, a debt that they can pay off by providing goods or services to another person in the network, who pays them with their own \u003Ci>tems\u003C/i> and brings their account back into balance.\nThe system does not permit people to go more than 300 \u003Ci>tems\u003C/i> into debt or to hoard more than 1,200 \u003Ci>tems\u003C/i> in their account.\nThis helps keep the currency stable, active, and close to its original intention as a facilitator of barter-like transactions.\n\n## Bitcoin\n\nAs I was preparing this book, the alternative currency on the rise was “bitcoin,” a form of currency that is backed by the full faith & credit of its community of users and the sophisticated and clever algorithm that they agree to use and that gives the currency value as a medium of exchange.\n\nBitcoins are composed of numbers, are minted by mathematics, usually never take material form, are nowhere recognized as legal tender, and are backed by no material goods… and yet they seem strikingly more secure and useful and dependable, at least in some ways, than the currencies we have grown used to (for which, on close inspection, many of these same frightening conclusions hold true).\n\nHere is an example of people using bitcoin to facilitate tax resistance:\n“Fr33 Aid” is a group of volunteers who organize free first aid and health services and who educate people about first aid skills (like CPR) and about the value of voluntary mutual aid at libertarian/anarchist-leaning conferences and other events in the United States.\nOn tax day in 2013, the group announced that they were giving up on their frustrating quest to gain government-certified nonprofit status.\nThey said they would instead try to withdraw from the state-monitored banking system and the use of state-controlled currency and instead do as much of their operations as possible in bitcoin.\n\n“When we founded Fr33 Aid in early 2011, the banks all required a taxpayer ID number and government paperwork,” said Teresa Warmke, Fr33 Aid’s co-founder and treasurer.\n“Bitcoin changed everything.\nWe can focus on our mission now that Fr33 Aid’s assets are safe in our Bitcoin wallet.”\n\nShe explained:\n“Now that there are ways for us to do banking without government involvement, we decided fulfilling [onerous IRS requirements for nonprofits] would not be a responsible way for Fr33 Aid to spend its money nor for our volunteers to spend their time.”\n\nThe organization will continue to accept donations denominated in dollars from people who have not yet adopted bitcoin, but it plans to convert such donations to bitcoin “in a timely manner.”\nThis way, Warmke says:\n“If at some point either the bank or a government tries to confiscate our account for taxes they believe we owe or failure to file paperwork, they would only be able to find a few dollars for their trouble.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n*

Kennedy, writing of what he called “economic secession,” put it this way:\n“Think of how much less profitable taxation would be if government didn’t know how much money you earned or how much money you had.\nThe Leviathan cannot extract the revenue necessary to sustain itself at anything like current levels without knowing where the money is.…\nif the means of economic privacy are available [people] must choose between keeping their own money in their own pockets or voluntarily turning it over to government.\nThen you’ll see economic secession on a grand scale.”\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>Here are some examples of how people have used alternative currencies to facilitate or augment tax resistance:\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"time-dollars\">Time Dollars\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The state of Missouri experimented with issuing what it called “Time Dollars” to people who volunteered to spend their time helping the elderly.\nThese volunteers could in turn use their Time Dollars to hire similar help if they needed it later on.\nThe state promised that it would honor these Time Dollars itself if no home care workers were available who would accept such currency.\nAlthough Missouri did not have a tax resistance motive in establishing this program, in 1985 they sought (and eventually obtained) an IRS ruling that Time Dollars did not represent taxable income.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Many alternative currency projects in the United States are trying to follow the Time Dollar model, in some cases with the explicit goal of helping tax resisters.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"norraths-britannian-gold-pieces--qq-coins\">Norraths, Britannian gold pieces, &#x26; QQ coins\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The currencies that are used in massively-multiplayer online (MMO) games are also plausible challengers to legal tender.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you’ve never played one of these games, you may be surprised at just how huge they have become, and just how many transactions take place in these fantasy currencies.\nAnd because players can sell their hard-won game-world belongings on real-world auction sites like eBay, it has become possible to exchange virtual money for real goods, real money for virtual goods, or virtual money for real money.\nIn 2001, an economist took the time to figure out what the exchange rate was between EverQuest Norraths and U.S. Dollars, and he concluded:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>[EverQuest has] the 77th largest economy in the world.

A unit of Norrath’s currency is traded on exchange markets at $0.0107, higher than the yen and the lira. The economy is characterized by extreme inequality, yet life there is quite attractive to many.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Note that when he says that EverQuest had the 77th largest economy in the world, he means the \u003Cem>real\u003C/em> world, not just the virtual world.\nTax agencies do not yet tax this thriving economy, though most of its transactions are (in theory at least) easily-traceable.\nJulian Dibbell wondered why the tax collector hasn’t come calling yet:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>If you haven’t misspent hours battling an Arctic Ogre Lord near an Ice Dungeon or been equally profligate spending time reading the published works of the Internal Revenue Service, you probably haven’t wondered whether the United States government will someday tax your virtual winnings from games played over the Internet.

What if I traded those assets for their value in Ultima Online’s official currency, the Britannian gold piece, rather than for dollars? Wouldn’t it be easy to establish their value in dollars nonetheless and, if I owed American taxes on the exchange, put a number on the deal that the IRS could grasp and love?

tax.",[],{"order":54,"hidden":39,"attrs":1501},{},"You can deprive the government of funds by boycotting goods sold by the government (or by government-protected monopolies that subsidize the government), or goods that are subject to a particular tax.\n\n## Revolts in British Colonies\n\nThe monopoly on tea imports that the British government enforced in the American colonies was “equal to a tax” in the eyes of Samuel Adams and his fellow patriots.\nResisters boycotted monopoly tea, and famously backed up this boycott with actions like the Boston Tea Party, in which they destroyed monopoly tea before it reached the marketplace.\n\nOther monopoly British imports that suffered from the American boycott included paper, cloth, dye, house paint, and glass.\nOne patriotic song celebrated the boycott (while at the same time educating listeners about its extent) in this way:\n\n> The use of the taxables, let us forbear:—\u003Cbr />\n> (Then merchants import till your stores are all full,\u003Cbr />\n> May the buyers be few, and your traffic be dull!)…\n>\n> …rather than freedom we part with our tea,\u003Cbr />\n> And well as we love the dear draught when a-dry,\u003Cbr />\n> As American Patriots our taste we deny—\u003Cbr />\n> Pennsylvania’s gay meadows can richly afford\u003Cbr />\n> To pamper our fancy or furnish our board;\u003Cbr />\n> And paper sufficient at home still we have,\u003Cbr />\n> To assure the wiseacre, we will not sign slave;\u003Cbr />\n> When this homespun shall fail, to remonstrate our grief,\u003Cbr />\n> We can speak viva voce, or scratch on a leaf;\u003Cbr />\n> Refuse all their colors, though richest of dye,\u003Cbr />\n> When the juice of a berry our paint can supply,\u003Cbr />\n> To humor our fancy—and as for our houses,\u003Cbr />\n> They’ll do without painting as well as our spouses;\u003Cbr />\n> While to keep out the cold of a keen winter morn,\u003Cbr />\n> We can screen the north-west with a well polished horn;\n\nThe Indian independence campaign also boycotted British-monopoly goods like salt and cloth.\nThe campaign not only encouraged people to wear only Indian-produced fabric and clothing, but it also held bonfires and asked people to burn all of the British cloth they owned.\n\n## American War Tax Resisters\n\nDuring the American war on Vietnam, “[o]ne pacifist, imprisoned for draft refusal and therefore lacking income to refuse taxes on, gave up smoking because the cigarette tax brings the government more revenue than any other single consumer-commodity tax.”\n\nAs internet telephony started to become an option, some American war tax resisters realized they could avoid the federal excise tax on telephone service by getting rid of their phone lines and switching to such internet-based plans.\n\n## Quakers\n\nWhen the Continental Congress imposed a tax on postage stamps to help pay for the American revolutionary war effort, Quaker James Mott decided to stop using the mail. He wrote to a friend shortly before the tax came into effect:\n\n> Must our correspondence by mail be at end, in consequence of the extra postage? or shall we pay it, and thereby contribute a mite to the support of measures calculated to destroy men’s lives and property? Perhaps I may be alone in refusing to pay postage on letters. Only a few cents—what can this do, it may be said, towards enabling government to prosecute the war? Very little, I own: but the great sum required is made up of littles; and if all those littles are withheld, the effusion of human blood may be at an end.\n\nMany years later, Congress issued revenue stamps that it required people to purchase and to apply to certain types of documents. One Quaker wrote in 1900:\n\n> I am one of those (I suppose there are others), who have felt an extreme unwillingness to help maintain our wars by the use of the revenue stamps, which were legalized expressly for war uses. Our forefathers would have made an emphatic protest against it, if indeed they would not have refused entirely to use the stamps, and borne the consequences, whatever they might have been.… at least we could restrict the use of checks (for example) wherever possible, and diminish in this way our contributions to the war fund.\n\nOther Quakers, like Isaac Martin, refused to use or to deal in imported goods, so as to avoid paying import duties that were being directed to military expenses:\n\n> [A] weighty concern attended my mind on account of a tax on shop keepers who dealt in foreign articles, to be appropriated towards carrying on the war against England.… I believed my peace of mind would be affected if I paid the said tax. So I resigned myself to the Lord’s will, let the event be as it may. But scarcely a day passed, that I had not to turn customers away who applied for articles which I had on hand, but could not sell, on account of the heavy penalty.\n\nMany Quaker meetings also had a policy of warning their members against “sharing or partaking in the spoils of war by purchasing or selling prize-goods”—that is, goods seized from the ships of enemy nations by government-sanctioned pirates.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War the North Columbus, Ohio, Friends Meeting was unable to agree on whether to reluctantly pay the federal excise tax on its office phone (a tax that had been extended to help pay for the war) or whether to illegally resist it.\nAs a compromise, the meeting decided to discontinue its phone service entirely.\n\n## Anti-Czarist Activism\n\nIn Russia around the time of the Vyborg Manifesto, a report noted that “the peasants are deciding to boycott all state-owned businesses.”\nFor example: “they have undertaken a concerted abstention from vodka, the manufacture and sale of which intoxicant was made a Government monopoly… [which] has since constituted one of the principal sources of the public revenue.”\n\n## Obstructing in Addition to Boycotting\n\nYou can augment a boycott by obstructing the sale of boycotted goods:\n\n* In Wales, truckers blockaded a Chevron refinery and called upon the tanker operators to join them in shutting it down, to protest the government’s tax on fuel.\n* Farmers in Argentina decided in 2009 to “halt sales of grains and livestock for a week, setting up roadblocks and hampering exports to press for lower taxes.”\n* In Greece resisters to taxes that were added to utility bills have barricaded the offices of utility companies.\n\n## Divestment and Boycotts of Nations\n\nIn 2003, as the U.S. was launching its attack on Iraq, anti-war activists from other countries began to promote a boycott of the products of U.S. government contractors, and even of U.S. companies in general.\n“The U.S. economy is strung out across the globe. Its economic outposts are exposed and vulnerable,” wrote Arundhati Roy.\n“Our strategy must be to isolate Empire’s working parts and disable them one by one.\nNo target is too small.\nNo victory too insignificant.”\n\nSimilarly, the “Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions” movement aims to boycott businesses that profit from Israeli settlement expansion in occupied Palestine.\n\nThe model for this approach is the movement that promoted divestment from apartheid South Africa.\nThat movement, which peaked in the 1980s, successfully pressured businesses, governments, and other institutions around the world to restrict or abandon their economic support for the regime and for those businesses that helped to prop it up.\nUniversities, targeted by persistent student activists, were among the more prominent institutions to divest from companies doing business in South Africa.\nIn one fell swoop in 1986, the entire University of California system divested itself of some $3 billion in apartheid-tainted investments.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Adams, Samuel \u003Ci>The Writings of Samuel Adams\u003C/i> Vol. I (1904) p. 142\n* Griffitts, Hannah “The Daughters of Liberty” \u003Ci>We Won’t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader\u003C/i> (2008), p. 86\n* Love, Kennett “Tax Resistance: Hell No—I Won’t Pay” \u003Ci>Washington Monthly\u003C/i> December 1969, pp. 60–65\n* Mott, James “The Postage Tax” \u003Ci>American Quaker War Tax Resistance\u003C/i>, 2nd. ed.

So I resigned myself to the Lord’s will, let the event be as it may.

resist.",[],{"order":720,"hidden":39,"attrs":1583},{},"An unusual method of tax resistance is to deliberately make yourself taxable in order to owe a tax that you can then resist, or, similarly, to defy some legal condition of your tax-exempt status so as to become subject to a tax that you can then refuse to pay.\nFor example:\n\n## Get a Dog to Resist the Dog Tax\n\nAnne Cobden Sanderson of the Women’s Tax Resistance League noted that only some women were subject to the income tax, but thought this shouldn’t discourage other women who wanted to become tax resisters.\n“Everyone who perhaps has not an income to be taxed can have a dog, and then refuse to pay [the dog license] tax.”\n\u003Ci>The New York Sun\u003C/i> editorialized:\n\n> By buying up dogs of all sorts and refusing to pay the licenses the suffragettes may get into jail with facility and honor. Why place a bomb on the front porch or spread carbolic acid in a mail box, when you may get jugged just as well merely by refusing to pay your dog tax?\n>\n> If one dog sent you to prison for one month, how many months would you be forced to serve if you owned 100 or 200 dogs? Meanwhile you might put on all the dogs blankets inscribed “Votes for Women” and turn them loose in the Strand to the confusion of the bobbies and Parliament.\n\n## Resisting Taxes on Phantom Income\n\nWar tax resister Ed Hedemann suggests that people in the United States who do not owe income taxes because their income is too low, but who want to be income tax resisters, deliberately inflate their declared income with “phantom income” when they file their tax returns so that they owe some small amount that they can then resist.\n\n## Pulpit Freedom Sunday\n\nA number of American preachers have made explicit political endorsements from the pulpit—and have even recorded these endorsements and sent the recordings to the government as proof.\nIn the United States, tax-exempt organizations like churches are not permitted to engage in political campaigns in this way.\nThe churches are daring the IRS to rescind the tax exemption of their churches, and have framed it as a freedom-of-speech/freedom-of-religion issue.\nOver the last several years, the number of churches participating in this protest tactic has risen from a few dozen to over a thousand, but the IRS has yet to take up their challenge.\n\n## Troubles with Tax-Exempt Status\n\nThe legal conditions of tax-exempt, nonprofit status in the United States have proven to be a powerful way for the government to make activist groups timid.\n\nAt one point the largely-liberal-leaning staff of the IRS was caught applying extraordinary and extra-legal scrutiny to the applications for tax-exempt status made by conservative groups.\nIn one case, they told the board of an anti-abortion group to sign an affidavit swearing that the group would not hold or sponsor protests at family planning clinics, as a condition of being granted tax-exempt status.\nAnother anti-abortion group was told that because its outreach material was “condemnatory and opinionated” with “no intelligent discussion of the subject of abortions” and because its activities “are designed to influence public opinion in favor of its advocated position” the group risked having its application denied.\n\nAnti-abortion tax resister Jerry DePyper noted that this sort of thing has been successful at intimidating the larger anti-abortion groups and was a big reason why he was making no headway in trying to get the tax resistance tactic on their agenda.\nHe spoke with two leaders in that movement and said:\n“Both… say that no recognized pro-life leader would want to risk it because of the legal issues with the IRS, and they don’t want to lose their tax-exempt status.”\n\nRuth Benn of NWTRCC had a similar experience:\n\n> I was talking about a potential war tax resistance workshop with a group for which I have great respect and who are very supportive of war tax resistance. When I suggested a certain activity as part of the workshop, the organizer hurriedly said, “Oh, no, we couldn’t sponsor that; we’re 501(c)3 [the section of the legal code that governs tax-exempt non-profits].”\n\nFor this and related reasons, some tax resisting groups, like Catholic Worker and NWTRCC, have never tried to apply for tax-exempt nonprofit status.\nIn 1972 the IRS told Catholic Worker that it owed some $300,000 in taxes and penalties because of this (the tax agency eventually retreated, acknowledging that Catholic Worker was a \u003Ci>de facto\u003C/i> nonprofit charity, even if it was never going to fill out the \u003Ci>de jure\u003C/i> paperwork).\n\nThis episode turned out to be a good propaganda opportunity for Catholic Worker.\nThe \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> editorialized:\n“Surely the IRS must have genuine frauds to investigate.\nSurely there must be some worthwhile work this agency could be doing instead of obstructing acts of corporal mercy for the poor.”\nDorothy Day added:\n\n> The \u003Ci>New York Evening Post\u003C/i> also editorialized on our situation.

Tax paying is the norm.\n1. Taxes are spent wisely for things of public benefit.\n1. Tax evaders will be caught and dealt with harshly.\n\nThese beliefs are mutually self-reinforcing:\nThe more people hold these beliefs, the more tax compliant they will be—and the more tax compliant people are, the more these beliefs will seem plausible.\n\nFor this reason, governments work hard to create a culture of taxpayer compliance.\nIf they succeed, compliance develops its own momentum and becomes easier to maintain.\nIt takes a lot less work for the government to keep taxpayer compliance from slipping from 90% to 80% than it does for the government to raise taxpayer compliance from 80% to 90%.\n\nIf taxpayer compliance is high, taxpayers will convince themselves of the three beliefs.\nA taxpayer may ask: “Why am I paying?” and then assume “Well, I must have good reasons: it’s because I’m a good citizen, and I want to contribute to useful things, and besides if I don’t I’ll get caught.\nEverybody knows these things.”\n\nIf taxpayer compliance is low, however, taxpayers have to \u003Cem>be\u003C/em> convinced—they ask instead: “Am I getting played for a fool?”\n\nGovernments spend a lot of effort trying to understand the psychology of taxpayer compliance and they engage in a lot of propaganda and other forms of manipulation in order to convince people to comply.\n\n![](../../../assets/donald-duck.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>Donald Duck learns about the importance of paying income taxes in \u003Ci>The Spirit of ’43\u003C/i>\u003C/figcaption>\n\nOne example is the World War II-era Disney short film \u003Ci>The Spirit of ’43\u003C/i> in which a skeptical Donald Duck learns that it will take “taxes to sink the Axis.”\nAnother is the 1955 short film \u003Ci>The Tsippori Affair\u003C/i>, produced by Israel’s propaganda department (with American help), in which audiences were shown what horrible things would happen if nobody paid their taxes (for instance, the schools would all shut down, and children would lounge about playing cards, drinking wine, and smoking cigarettes).\n\n### Belief #1: Tax Paying Is the Norm\n\nHere is an example of how the U.S. government props up this belief:\nEvery year the IRS conducts something it calls the “Taxpayer Attitude Survey” in which it asks a set of questions to 1,500 randomly-phoned Americans.\nThe survey contains carefully-loaded questions like these (emphasis mine):\n\n* “How much, if any, do you think is an acceptable amount to \u003Cem>cheat\u003C/em> on your income taxes?”\n* “[Do you agree that] it is every American’s civic duty to pay their \u003Cem>fair share\u003C/em> of taxes?”\n* “[Do you agree that] everyone who \u003Cem>cheats\u003C/em> on their taxes should be held accountable?”\n\nPredictably, people overwhelmingly report that they believe cheating is bad and fair shares are good.\nThe IRS then puts out a press release that trumpets these results and claims they demonstrate that Americans overwhelmingly believe everybody should pay what the government demands.\nTypically the lazy news media go along with it, composing stories that follow the press release script.\n\nA tax resistance campaign can attack this “taxpaying is the norm” belief by reinforcing a different message:\n“Lots of people don’t pay taxes:\nRich people with off-shore bank accounts—big corporations with crafty lobbyists—people who know the right people in the right places—and even ordinary people like you and me who know how the game is played.\nIf you’re paying everything the government says you owe, you’re paying a lot more than your ‘fair share.’”\n\nOne way you can spread this message is with stories about well-known people who successfully avoid their taxes (there always seem to be plenty of stories like these), and also stories about resisters and evaders who are “ordinary people like yourself.”\n\nFor example, when President Obama’s first Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, was being confirmed by the Senate, the news came out that he had failed to declare some of his income on his tax returns and had taken some improper deductions.\nCases like this reinforce the idea that everybody is trying to pull one over on the tax collector—even the fellow in charge of the tax collection agency himself!\n\n![licensed from Ken Mayer under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license](../../../assets/billionaires-for-bush.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>“Billionaires for Bush” protesters\u003C/figcaption>\n\nA group of war tax resisters from the Bangor (Maine) Peace & Justice Center used this tactic in a tax day action:\nThey put on formal gowns and tuxedos, rented a white stretch limousine, and went down to the dual post office/federal building “to perform a bit of satire-filled street theater.”\nCalling themselves the “Rich People’s Liberation Front,” they meant their performance “to expose the huuuge tax breaks which America’s corporations and our wealthiest citizens receive.”\nThey passed out candy suckers to the people who were lining up to pay their taxes—“Suckers for the suckers!”\nAnother group, calling itself “Billionaires for [U.S. President George W.] Bush,” protested in tuxedos, carrying signs reading “Taxes are not for everyone” and “Thank you for paying our fair share.”\n\nSimply coming “out of the closet” as a tax resister can be helpful. If people stereotype tax resisters as antisocial eccentrics who are nothing like themselves, they’ll be reluctant to resist—but if they see ordinary people like their neighbors resisting, they may be willing to consider the idea afresh. One journalist who interviewed a tax evader was surprised to find that he was just an ordinary guy:\n\n> In my mind, the Tax Evader has a scraggly beard, eats a lot of salt pork and beans, and owns either a copy of Thoreau or some antigovernment tract self-published in Montana. Just as the Tax Evader doesn’t believe in taxes, he also doesn’t go for showers. He is suspicious, owns at least one gun and tends to believe the IRS is always sneaking up on him. His body is gnarled and contorted by the lumps of cash he stores in his mattress. Because I don’t want to be the Tax Evader, I pay my taxes.\n\nCan it really be that there are people who pay their taxes because they’re afraid that if they don’t they’ll transform into the Unabomber by some bizarre alchemy?\nApparently so.\n\n### Belief #2: Taxes Are Spent Wisely\n\nIn 2012, an IRS advisory group surveyed two groups of American “sole proprietors” (independent contractors or people who run small businesses).\nOne of these groups consisted of taxpayers the agency viewed as being most likely to be cheating on their taxes, and the other group was at the other end of the spectrum, being thought by the agency to be the most fastidious about reporting their income and paying what was due.\n\nThey asked a series of questions to try to draw out what attitudes and characteristics were correlated with belonging to each group.\nThe answers were surprising:\n\n* Were the less-compliant taxpayers less likely to think tax evaders would get caught?\n  \u003Cem>No\u003C/em>—in fact just the opposite.\n* Were they more likely to think that tax evasion is financially advantageous—in other words, that tax evaders are likely to come out ahead?\n  \u003Cem>No again:\u003C/em> they were \u003Cem>more\u003C/em> likely to think tax evaders were taking a bad gamble and would probably end up worse off.\n* Were they more likely to think that their business competitors were cheating on \u003Cem>their\u003C/em> taxes and that therefore they had to cheat to stay competitive?\n  \u003Cem>No:\u003C/em> actually the \u003Cem>more\u003C/em>-compliant taxpayers were more likely to suspect their peers of being tax evaders.\n* Maybe the less-compliant group just didn’t think there was anything wrong with tax evasion?\n  \u003Cem>No:\u003C/em> fully 97% of them claimed to believe that everybody ought to report all of their income and pay all of their taxes dutifully.\n\nWhat really distinguished the less-compliant group were two things:\n\n1. They had a more negative impression of the government and the tax agency (“For example, respondents from the low-compliance group were more likely to report that the government is too big and wastes tax dollars, that tax laws are unfair, and that the IRS is unfair”).\n1. They were more likely to be active participants in community groups, and to believe that other people in those groups shared these negative appraisals of the government.\n\nWhile a cynic might suspect that economic self-interest or fear of the long arm of the law are at the forefront of people’s minds when they decide whether or not to pay their taxes, this study shows that what may really make the difference is how they feel about whether they’re getting their money’s worth or whether the government is giving them a square deal.\n\nThe government is always eager to draw your attention when it spends your money on something nice.\nThere’s hardly a bridge, library, overpass, park, or other publicly-funded thing in my hometown that doesn’t have a plaque attached to it somewhere that lists the names of the city councillors and mayor who signed off on it—although that’s about all they had to do to get their names in brass.\n\nAnd whenever tax revenue threatens to fall, those government departments that fear budget cuts will quickly rush out press releases saying that the most popular parts of their budgets will certainly be the first ones hurt.\nIn the United States, the tactic has come to be known as “The Washington Monument Ploy” since 1969, when the head of the U.S. National Park Service responded to budget cuts by eliminating public access to popular attractions like the Washington Monument and the Grand Canyon for two days a week until Congress restored the funding.\n\nWhile the government is busily reminding people of the good things it does with your tax money, you need to make sure the opposite message gets through loud and clear:\n“The government squanders your hard-earned money by spending it wastefully and by giving padded government contracts to well-connected insiders.\nThanks to the government, undeserving and crooked people are getting rich at the expense of hard-working taxpayers.”\n\nYou can do this by spreading the news of government corruption and spending boondoggles (you won’t have much trouble finding good examples).\n\nYou may also find it helpful to contrast the way the government is \u003Cem>actually\u003C/em> spending its budget with the way people wish it were.\nAmerican war tax resistance groups often hold what they call “penny polls.”\nThey set up a table in a public space and invite passers-by to drop pennies into columns marked with certain federal budget categories: military, health & welfare, environment, education, and so forth.\nThe passers-by are asked, in effect: pretend that you are deciding how to spend the country’s tax revenue—where do you think it should go?\nAs the pennies rise in the columns, this creates a sort of vote, by the congress of passers-by, on what they think the country’s spending priorities should be.\nThey are then invited to compare their priorities to the real numbers in the budget.\nThe contrast is usually very discouraging.\n\n![](../../../assets/penny-poll.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>an on-line “penny poll” presented participants with pie charts that contrast their own spending priorities with actual U.S. federal spending\u003C/figcaption>\n\nThe Mennonite Central Committee turned the penny poll idea into an on-line game, and another website put together something similar:\na $3 trillion dollar shopping spree to give Americans an idea of what kind of cool things their country could be investing in if the government weren’t spending so much of their money on war.\n\nAmerican Libertarian Party activists often will hand out fake million dollar bills, each one printed with an estimate of how quickly the U.S. government spends that much money.\nOne American war tax resistance group held a tax day protest in which they labeled the mailboxes at the post office with the names of military contractors like Lockheed-Martin, Halliburton, and Bechtel, as a way of pointing out where the tax money was really going to end up.\nAds in the \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> before tax day, 1970, read “April 15th is ‘Support the Pentagon’ Day.”\nUnder that headline was a cartoon featuring a hapless taxpayer with a bit in his mouth and a load of generals, admirals, and armaments riding on his back.\n\nAwareness of government spending is somewhat related to what tax wonks call the “salience” of taxation—that is, how aware you are of the hand that is picking your pocket.\nYour income tax would be very salient if you had to write a check to the government every couple of weeks.\nBut if the money is automatically withheld from your paycheck before you get your hands on it, it’s less salient.\nIt would be less salient still if the tax were invisibly included in the price of the goods you buy.\nGovernments are eager to find ways to tax people in ways that make them less aware that they’re being taxed, because the less you’re aware of it the less you’ll complain (or resist).\nFor this reason, people hoping to \u003Cem>promote\u003C/em> tax evasion should try to \u003Cem>improve\u003C/em> people’s consciousness of being taxed.\n\nFor example, the Tax Foundation raises a ballyhoo every year about what it calls “Tax Freedom Day”—“the day when the [United States] as a whole has earned enough money to pay off its total tax bill for the year.”\nThis date has lately been arriving about the same time as federal income tax returns are due, which increases the press coverage.\nThe Foundation hopes that on Tax Freedom Day people will remember all of the work that they have done since January 1st, and will realize resentfully how much they’ve been working to earn money for the politicians and their priorities.\n\n### Belief #3: Tax Evaders Will Be Caught\n\nIn the weeks before tax day the IRS usually breathlessly announces indictments against famous people and big-time tax evaders.\nThe implicit message: don’t think of stepping out of line because you’re sure to get caught.\nAnecdotes can speak louder than statistics when the government tries to convince people that tax resistance is a dangerous pastime.\n\nBut you can fight back with anecdotes of your own (and often statistics, too, if it comes down to that).\n“Evaders usually get away with it,” you can say.\nPublicize examples of people (or businesses) who have been resisting or evading for a long time and getting away with it.\n\nAmerican war tax resister Wally Nelson was fond of carrying a sign or sandwich-board reading “Haven’t Paid Taxes Since 1948” (he died in 2002, and still hadn’t paid).\nThe unwritten but implicit continuation of the message is “…and they haven’t caught me yet, and I’m not afraid of them!”\nHis sign was an instant rejoinder to the fear that tax resistance is a guaranteed ticket to prison.\n\nOn a few occasions tax resisters have turned themselves in to the authorities to show how little they are afraid of prosecution.\nFor instance, in Australia’s Northern Territory in 1921, “the residents drew up a monster petition, which almost everybody signed, and insisted on the government standing up to its own laws by taking action against them.\nThey also defied the government to put them into jail.”\nAnd in 2000, three war tax resisters went to the IRS headquarters in Washington to turn themselves in.\n“If the resisters are not arrested and prosecuted,” Mary Loehr of NWTRCC said (and they weren’t, and still haven’t been), “it will expose the myth that people go to jail for not paying their taxes.”\n\n### These Attacks Are Also Mutually Self-Reinforcing\n\nNote that these attacks on the beliefs that reinforce tax compliance are also mutually self-reinforcing:\nThe less people hold these beliefs, the less compliant they will be.\nAnd the less compliant people are, the less plausible these beliefs will seem.\n\nYale professor James C. Scott has studied resistance to government-mandated tithing in Malaysia (and elsewhere).\nHe noted that once tax resistance “has become a customary practice it generates its own expectations about what is permissible [and] raises the political and administrative costs for any regime that subsequently decides it will enforce the rules in earnest.\nFor everyday resisters there is safety in numbers and successful resistance builds its own momentum.”\n\n## The Direct Approach\n\nThe examples I have given mostly concern ways of promoting an atmosphere in which tax evasion seems like a good idea.\nBut there are also more direct ways people can assist in the tax evasion of others.\nI’ve already mentioned the tactic of paying in cash so that your transactions leave less of a paper trail for the government to follow (see [Switch to Cash](../switchtocash/)).\nHere are a couple of others:\n\nYou can manufacture the paraphernalia of tax evasion.\nFor example, in Mexico City, you can visit a taco stand and walk away not only with lunch, but—for a small price—with fake receipts from a variety of restaurants, hotels, and stores, that you can then use to document spurious business expenses on your tax returns.\n\nYou can also spread rumors that a tax has been abolished.\nThis worked with great success at the time of the French Revolution, when such rumors became self-fulfilling prophecies.\nThis was also common in Czarist Russia, when people extrapolated from the propaganda-fuelled image of a benevolent Czar to conclude that a Czar so good \u003Cem>must\u003C/em> have abolished such awful taxes.\nAnd the United States has long had a cottage industry of people who are convinced (and convincing) that the real United States Constitution (America’s “benevolent Czar”) would never permit something as awful as the federal income tax (see resonate with myths, legends, folklore, or historical examples).\n\nAnother example of this is the “black tax credit” which became a craze in the United States for a while.\nIn 1993, the columnist Lena Sherrod wrote that racial discrimination in the United States amounts to “a hidden Black tax”—and she estimated that Black households have each lost $43,209 to this tax since the days of Jim Crow.\nShe concluded her column with this tongue-in-cheek advice:\n\n> So when income-tax time rolls around, on line 59 of form 1040—which asks you to list “other payments”—simply enter $43,209 in “Black taxes” and compute accordingly.\n\nThe rumor mill took Sherrod’s smirking suggestion and transformed it into a bona fide urban legend.\nTens of thousands of people applied for the fictitious “black tax credit” and the IRS mistakenly granted tens of millions of dollars in refunds because of it.\n\n## Why Promote Tax Evasion?\n\nThis is a good example of where different varieties of tax resister will likely form very different opinions about the usefulness and wisdom of a tactic (see [Varieties of Tax Resister](../varietiesofresister/introduction/)).\n\nIf your campaign is largely focused on protest and you were to encourage a bunch of people to evade their taxes for non-idealistic reasons it would be more likely to confuse your message than to enhance your protest.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are trying to deprive the government of resources as a way of forcing it to change, you may feel “the more, the merrier” and welcome tax evaders of all stripes.\nAnd if you are evading a tax as a conscientious objector, because you feel that paying the tax would itself be wrong, then you might feel that it’s better that people resist the tax selfishly and without knowing why than that they pay it from misplaced feelings of civic duty.\n\nThere is another possible problem with promoting tax evasion:\nIf your campaign aspires to reform or replace the existing government, should you succeed you may want those taxpayers to become compliant again.\nHowever, once you have eroded the beliefs that support taxpayer compliance it’s hard to restore them.\n\nFor example, the state of Israel was founded after a resistance campaign that included tax resistance against the British administration of Palestine.\nAfter Israel won its independence, it found that its citizens were reluctant to give up the habit of tax resistance, and the government had to put a great deal of effort into changing people’s minds.\nIn the United States, also, an independence struggle that prominently included tax resistance led to an independent government that almost immediately was faced with tax revolts like the Whiskey Rebellion, the Fries Rebellion, and the Shays Rebellion—often led by rebels who felt themselves to be acting in the patriotic, revolutionary tradition.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* “The Spirit of ’43” Walt Disney Studios (1943)\n* Likhovski, Assaf “Training in Citizenship: Tax Compliance and Modernity” \u003Ci>Law & Social Inquiry\u003C/i>, Vol. 32, No. 3.

you can encourage more people to evade taxes, even merely for self-interested reasons, you will take additional resources away from the government and increase the number of targets that tax enforcers

large.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"eroding-the-beliefs-that-underlie-taxpayer-compliance\">Eroding the Beliefs that Underlie Taxpayer Compliance\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>There are three beliefs that a

mutually self-reinforcing:\nThe more people hold these beliefs, the more tax compliant they will be—and the more tax compliant people are, the more these beliefs will seem plausible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For this reason, governments work hard to create a culture of taxpayer compliance.\nIf they succeed, compliance develops its own momentum and becomes easier to maintain.\nIt takes a lot less work for the government to keep taxpayer compliance from slipping from 90% to 80% than it does for the government to raise taxpayer compliance from 80% to 90%.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If taxpayer compliance is high, taxpayers will convince themselves of the three beliefs.\nA taxpayer may ask: “Why am I paying?” and then assume “Well, I must have good reasons: it’s because I’m a good citizen, and I want to contribute to useful things, and besides if I don’t I’ll get caught.\nEverybody knows these things.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If taxpayer compliance is low,

Donald Duck learns that it will take “taxes to sink the Axis.”\nAnother is the 1955 short film \u003Ci>The Tsippori Affair\u003C/i>, produced by Israel’s propaganda department (with American help), in which audiences were shown what horrible things would happen if nobody paid their taxes (for instance, the schools would all shut down, and children would lounge about playing cards, drinking wine, and smoking cigarettes).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"belief-1-tax-paying-is-the-norm\">Belief #1: Tax Paying Is the Norm\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Here is an example of how the U.S. government props up this belief:\nEvery year the IRS conducts something it calls the “Taxpayer Attitude Survey” in which it asks a set of questions to 1,500 randomly-phoned Americans.\nThe survey contains carefully-loaded questions like these (emphasis mine):\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>“How much, if any, do you think is an acceptable amount to \u003Cem>cheat\u003C/em> on your income taxes?”\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“[Do you agree that] it is every American’s civic duty to pay their \u003Cem>fair share\u003C/em> of taxes?”\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“[Do you agree that] everyone who \u003Cem>cheats\u003C/em> on their taxes should be held accountable?”\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Predictably, people overwhelmingly report that they believe cheating is bad and fair shares are good.\nThe IRS then puts out a press release that trumpets these results and claims they demonstrate that Americans overwhelmingly believe everybody should pay what the government demands.\nTypically the lazy news media go along with it, composing stories that follow the press release script.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A tax resistance campaign can attack this “taxpaying is the norm” belief by reinforcing a different message:\n“Lots of people don’t pay taxes:\nRich people with off-shore bank accounts—big corporations with crafty lobbyists—people who know the right people in the right places—and even ordinary people like you and me who know how the game is played.\nIf you’re paying everything the government says you owe, you’re paying a lot more than your ‘fair share.’”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One way you can spread this message is with stories about well-known people who successfully avoid their taxes (there always seem to be plenty of stories like these), and also stories about resisters and evaders who are “ordinary people like yourself.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For example, when President Obama’s first Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, was being confirmed by the Senate, the news came out that he had failed to declare some of his income on his tax returns and had taken some improper deductions.\nCases like this reinforce the idea that everybody is trying to pull one over on the tax collector—even the fellow in charge of the tax collection agency himself!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/billionaires-for-bush.gif&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;licensed from Ken

resisters from the Bangor (Maine) Peace &#x26; Justice Center used this tactic in a tax day action:\nThey put on formal gowns and tuxedos, rented a white stretch limousine, and went down to the dual post office/federal building “to perform a bit of satire-filled street theater.”\nCalling themselves the “Rich People’s Liberation Front,” they meant their performance “to expose the huuuge tax breaks which America’s corporations and our wealthiest citizens receive.”\nThey passed out candy suckers to the people who were lining up to pay their taxes—“Suckers for the suckers!”\nAnother group, calling itself “Billionaires for [U.S. President George W.] Bush,” protested in tuxedos, carrying signs reading “Taxes are not for everyone” and “Thank you for paying our fair share.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Simply coming “out of the closet” as a tax resister can be helpful. If people stereotype tax resisters as antisocial eccentrics who are nothing like themselves, they’ll be reluctant to resist—but if they see ordinary people like their neighbors resisting, they may be willing to consider the idea afresh. One journalist who interviewed a tax evader was surprised to find that he was just an ordinary guy:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>In my mind, the Tax Evader has a scraggly beard, eats a lot of salt pork and beans, and owns either a copy of Thoreau or some antigovernment tract self-published in Montana.

Because I don’t want to be the Tax Evader, I pay my taxes.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Can it really be that there are people who pay their taxes because they’re afraid that if they don’t

IRS advisory group surveyed two groups of American “sole proprietors” (independent contractors or people who run small businesses).\nOne of these groups consisted of taxpayers the agency viewed as being most likely to be cheating on their taxes, and the other group was at the other end of the spectrum, being thought by the agency to be the most fastidious about reporting their income and paying what was due.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They asked a series of questions to try to draw out what attitudes and characteristics were correlated with belonging to each group.\nThe answers were surprising:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Were the less-compliant taxpayers less likely to think tax evaders would get caught?\n\u003Cem>No\u003C/em>—in fact just the opposite.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Were they more likely to think that tax evasion is financially advantageous—in other words, that tax evaders are likely to come out ahead?\n\u003Cem>No again:\u003C/em> they were \u003Cem>more\u003C/em> likely to think tax evaders were taking a bad gamble and would probably end up worse off.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Were they more likely to think that their business competitors were cheating on \u003Cem>their\u003C/em> taxes and that therefore they had to cheat to stay competitive?\n\u003Cem>No:\u003C/em> actually the \u003Cem>more\u003C/em>-compliant taxpayers were more likely to suspect their peers of being tax evaders.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Maybe the less-compliant group just didn’t think there was anything wrong with tax evasion?\n\u003Cem>No:\u003C/em> fully 97% of them claimed to believe that everybody ought to report all of their income and pay all of their taxes dutifully.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>What really distinguished the less-compliant group were two things:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>They had a more negative impression of the government and the tax agency (“For example, respondents from the low-compliance group were more likely to report that the government is too big and wastes tax dollars, that tax laws are unfair, and that the IRS is unfair”).\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>They were more likely to be active participants in community groups, and to believe that other people in those groups shared these negative appraisals of the government.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>While a cynic might suspect that economic self-interest or fear of the long arm of the law are at the forefront of people’s minds when they decide whether or not to pay their taxes, this study shows that what may really make the difference is how they feel about whether they’re getting their money’s worth or whether the government is giving them a square deal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The government is always eager to draw your attention when it spends your money on something nice.\nThere’s hardly a bridge, library, overpass, park, or other publicly-funded thing in my hometown that doesn’t have a plaque attached to it somewhere that lists the names of the city councillors and mayor who signed off on it—although that’s about all they had to do to get their names in brass.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And whenever tax revenue threatens to fall, those government departments that fear budget cuts will quickly rush out press releases saying that the most popular parts of their budgets will certainly be the first ones hurt.\nIn the United States, the tactic has come to be known as “The Washington Monument Ploy” since 1969, when the head of the U.S. National Park Service responded to budget cuts by eliminating public access to popular attractions like the Washington Monument and the Grand Canyon for two days a week until Congress restored the funding.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While the government is busily reminding people of the good things it does with your tax money, you need to make sure the opposite message gets through loud and clear:\n“The government squanders your hard-earned money by spending it wastefully and by giving padded government contracts to well-connected insiders.\nThanks to the government, undeserving and crooked people are getting rich at the expense of hard-working taxpayers.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You can do this by spreading the news of government corruption and spending boondoggles (you won’t have much trouble finding good examples).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You may also find it helpful to contrast the way the government is \u003Cem>actually\u003C/em> spending its budget with the way people wish it were.\nAmerican war tax resistance groups often hold what they call “penny polls.”\nThey set up a table in a public space and invite passers-by to drop pennies into columns marked with certain federal budget categories: military, health &#x26; welfare, environment, education, and so forth.\nThe passers-by are asked, in effect: pretend that you are deciding how to spend the country’s tax revenue—where do you think it should go?\nAs the pennies rise in the columns, this creates a sort of vote, by the congress of passers-by, on what they think the country’s spending priorities should be.\nThey are then invited to compare their priorities to the real numbers in the budget.\nThe contrast is usually very discouraging.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg

participants with pie charts that contrast their own spending priorities with actual U.S. federal spending\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003Cp>The Mennonite Central Committee turned the penny poll idea into an on-line game, and another website put together something similar:\na $3 trillion dollar shopping spree to give Americans an idea of what kind of cool things their country could be investing in if the government weren’t spending so much of their money on war.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>American Libertarian Party activists often will hand out fake million dollar bills, each one printed with an estimate of how quickly the U.S. government spends that much money.\nOne American war tax resistance group held a tax day protest in which they labeled the mailboxes at the post office with the names of military contractors like Lockheed-Martin, Halliburton, and Bechtel, as a way of pointing out where the tax money was really going to end up.\nAds in the \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> before tax day, 1970, read “April 15th is ‘Support the Pentagon’ Day.”\nUnder that headline was a cartoon featuring a hapless taxpayer with a bit in his mouth and a load of generals, admirals, and armaments riding on his back.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Awareness of government spending is somewhat related to what tax wonks call the “salience” of taxation—that is, how aware you are of the hand that is picking your pocket.\nYour income tax would be very salient if you had to write a check to the government every couple of weeks.\nBut if the money is automatically withheld from your paycheck before you get your hands on it, it’s less salient.\nIt would be less salient still if the tax were invisibly included in the price of the goods you buy.\nGovernments are eager to find ways to tax people in ways that make them less aware that they’re being taxed, because the less you’re aware of it the less you’ll complain (or resist).\nFor this reason, people hoping to \u003Cem>promote\u003C/em> tax evasion should try to \u003Cem>improve\u003C/em> people’s consciousness of being taxed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For example, the Tax Foundation raises a ballyhoo every year about what it calls “Tax Freedom Day”—“the day when the [United States] as a whole has earned enough money to pay off its total tax bill for the year.”\nThis date has lately been arriving about the same time as federal income tax returns are due, which increases the press coverage.\nThe Foundation hopes that on Tax Freedom Day people will remember all of the work that they have done since January 1st, and will realize resentfully how much they’ve been working to earn money for the politicians and their priorities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"belief-3-tax-evaders-will-be-caught\">Belief #3: Tax Evaders Will Be Caught\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In the weeks before tax day the IRS usually breathlessly announces indictments against famous people and big-time tax evaders.\nThe implicit message: don’t think of stepping out of line because you’re sure to get caught.\nAnecdotes can speak louder than statistics when the government tries to convince people that tax resistance is a dangerous pastime.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But you can fight back with anecdotes of your own (and often statistics, too, if it comes down to that).\n“Evaders usually get away with it,” you can say.\nPublicize examples of people (or businesses) who have been resisting or evading for a long time and getting away with it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>American war tax resister Wally Nelson was fond of carrying a sign or sandwich-board reading “Haven’t Paid Taxes Since 1948” (he died in 2002, and still hadn’t paid).\nThe unwritten but implicit continuation of the message is “…and they haven’t caught me yet, and I’m not afraid of them!”\nHis sign was an instant rejoinder to the fear that tax resistance is a guaranteed ticket to prison.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On a few occasions tax resisters have turned themselves in to the authorities to show how little they are afraid of prosecution.\nFor instance, in Australia’s Northern Territory in 1921, “the residents drew up a monster petition, which almost everybody signed, and insisted on the government standing up to its own laws by taking action against them.\nThey also defied the government to put them into jail.”\nAnd in 2000, three war tax resisters went to the IRS headquarters in Washington to turn themselves in.\n“If the resisters are not arrested and prosecuted,” Mary Loehr of NWTRCC said (and they weren’t, and still haven’t been), “it will expose the myth that people go to jail for not paying their taxes.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"these-attacks-are-also-mutually-self-reinforcing\">These Attacks Are Also Mutually Self-Reinforcing\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Note that these attacks on the beliefs that reinforce tax compliance are also mutually self-reinforcing:\nThe less people hold these beliefs, the less compliant they will be.\nAnd the less compliant people are, the less plausible these beliefs will seem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yale professor James C. Scott has studied resistance to government-mandated tithing in Malaysia (and elsewhere).\nHe noted that once tax resistance “has become a customary practice it generates its own expectations about what is permissible [and] raises the political and administrative costs for any regime that subsequently decides it will enforce the rules in earnest.\nFor everyday resisters there is safety in numbers and successful resistance builds its own momentum.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-direct-approach\">The Direct Approach\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The examples I have given mostly concern ways of promoting an atmosphere in which tax evasion seems like a good idea.\nBut there are also more direct ways people can assist in the tax evasion of others.\nI’ve already mentioned the tactic of paying in cash so that your transactions leave less of a paper trail for the government to follow (see \u003Ca href=\"../switchtocash/\">Switch to Cash\u003C/a>).\nHere are a couple of others:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You can manufacture the paraphernalia of tax evasion.\nFor example, in Mexico City, you can visit a taco stand and walk away not only with lunch, but—for a small price—with fake receipts from a variety of restaurants, hotels, and stores, that you can then use to document spurious business expenses on your tax returns.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You can also spread rumors that a tax has been abolished.\nThis worked with great success at the time of the French Revolution, when such rumors became self-fulfilling prophecies.\nThis was also common in Czarist Russia, when people extrapolated from the propaganda-fuelled image of a benevolent Czar to conclude that a Czar so good \u003Cem>must\u003C/em> have abolished such awful taxes.\nAnd the United States has long had a cottage industry of people who are convinced (and convincing) that the real United States Constitution (America’s “benevolent Czar”) would never permit something as awful as the federal income tax (see resonate with myths, legends, folklore, or historical examples).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another example of this is the “black tax credit” which became a craze in the United States for a while.\nIn 1993, the columnist Lena Sherrod wrote that racial discrimination in the United States amounts to “a hidden Black tax”—and she estimated that Black households have each lost $43,209 to this tax since the days of Jim Crow.\nShe concluded her column with this tongue-in-cheek advice:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>So when income-tax time rolls around, on line 59 of form 1040—which asks you to list “other payments”—simply enter $43,209 in “Black taxes” and compute accordingly.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>The rumor mill took Sherrod’s smirking suggestion and transformed it into a bona fide urban legend.\nTens of thousands of people applied for the fictitious “black tax credit” and the IRS mistakenly granted tens of millions of dollars in refunds because of it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"why-promote-tax-evasion\">Why Promote Tax Evasion?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This is a good example of where different varieties of tax resister will likely form very different opinions about the usefulness and wisdom of a tactic (see \u003Ca href=\"../varietiesofresister/introduction/\">Varieties of Tax Resister\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If your campaign is largely focused on protest and you were to encourage a bunch of people to evade their taxes for non-idealistic reasons it would be more likely to confuse your message than to enhance your protest.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the other hand, if you are trying to deprive the government of resources as a way of forcing it to change, you may feel “the more, the merrier” and welcome tax evaders of all stripes.\nAnd if you are evading a tax as a conscientious objector, because you feel that paying the tax would itself be wrong, then you might feel that it’s better that people resist the tax selfishly and without knowing why than that they pay it from misplaced feelings of civic duty.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is another possible problem with promoting tax evasion:\nIf your campaign aspires to reform or replace the existing government, should you succeed you may want those taxpayers to become compliant again.\nHowever, once you have eroded the beliefs that support taxpayer compliance it’s hard to restore them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For example, the state of Israel was founded after a resistance campaign that included tax resistance against the British administration of Palestine.\nAfter Israel won its independence, it found that its citizens were reluctant to give up the habit of tax resistance, and the government had to put a great deal of effort into changing people’s minds.\nIn the United States, also, an independence struggle that prominently included tax resistance led to an independent government that almost immediately was faced with tax revolts like the Whiskey Rebellion, the Fries Rebellion, and the Shays Rebellion—often led by rebels who felt themselves to be acting in the patriotic, revolutionary tradition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>“The Spirit of ’43” Walt Disney Studios (1943)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Likhovski,

They went from door to door making collections, and organised early in July a Bardoli Day of their own, led a successful procession in pouring rain, money pouring in the Sardar’s car as it threaded its way through the crowds. Various purses amounting to over Rs.24,000 were presented to the Sardar at the meeting in the Empire theatre, where the youth honoured the beloved leader and received with applause his call to go and have their first lessons in public service in the Bardoli University.\n>\n> The Satyagraha Fund met with a response almost unique in the history of the nation. Cheques and money orders were received every day at Bardoli, at Satyagraha Ashram and at the \u003Ci>Navajivan\u003C/i> and \u003Ci>Young India\u003C/i> offices. The contributions came not only from all the provinces, but from the most distant parts of the land, not only from distant lands like France, Belgium, Japan, and China, but from the most remote corners of the globe including New Zealand, Malay States, and Fiji.…\n>\n> Bombay had several meetings addressed by that expert national beggar Manilal Kothari who levied his tribute of handsome amounts from barristers and advocates some of whom had never contributed towards a movement of this kind. Anything was acceptable to him. “If you cannot give a handsome cheque, you can give your car,” he would say in his seductive way, and thanks to his efforts, the workers in Bardoli had timely use of no less than four cars to help their whirlwind campaign.\n\n## Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca Rioters knew how to make their tollgate destruction popular among people who couldn’t (or wouldn’t) participate directly.\n\nOn the night before market day in Cardigan, Rebeccaites destroyed the Rhos Gate, the Rhydyfuwch Gate, and the gate on the Llangoedmore road near Cardigan.\nWhen the market opened, “every one who drove in was exempted from paying the usual toll, except those who came over the coach-road.\nThe people, looking at things from that point of view, were filled with Rebeccaite enthusiasm.\nOn that day nothing was heard at public-houses but proposals of good health and long life to Rebecca.”\n\nOn another occasion, Rebecca and her daughters pointedly left intact the gates on “the Queen’s high road” but destroyed those on roads that the various parishes were required to maintain.\n“This rendered Rebecca not unpopular amongst some farmers and others, many of whom paid the fine rather than be sworn in as special constables [to hunt for Rebecca and her daughters].”\n\nThe Rebeccaites also sometimes resorted to threats to induce reluctant bystanders to participate.\nIn one example:\n\n> All male inhabitants being householders of the hundred [district], were to meet at eleven o’clock on the following Thursday, at the “Plough and Harrow,” Newchurch parish, to march in procession to Carmarthen—to defy the Mayor and magistrates, and to destroy the gate on their return. Rich and poor were to be compelled to attend, and in case of illness a substitute must be found. All owners of horses were to ride. All persons absent without a sufficient excuse or substitute were to have their houses and barns destroyed by fire.\n\nIn another example:\n\n> [I]n order to ensure a full attendance of her followers, the church doors in the neighbourhood of Elvet were covered with notices in the dead of night, signed by “’Becca,” commanding all males above the age of sixteen and under seventy to appear at the “Plough and Harrow” on the morning of the 19th under pain of having their houses burnt and their lives sacrificed. The time and place of meeting were also published by word of mouth at most of the Dissenting meeting-houses throughout the hundred, and wherever a disinclination was known to exist on the part of any person to join in the procession and to take part in the intended proceedings, he was privately admonished if he wished to protect his property from the firebrand of the midnight incendiary, and to excuse himself from personal injury, that he had better join the procession—“or else.” This species of intimidation had the effect of drawing together immense numbers to the place of rendezvous.\n\nAt one point the Rebeccaites threatened an attorney in order to make him join them on one of their destructive sprees, “so that if any proceedings were subsequently taken, he as local solicitor might be made a party to them.”\nThey sometimes also forced the toll gate operators to take part in the destruction of their own toll houses.\n\n## Beit Sahour\n\nWhen residents of Beit Sahour launched a tax strike against the Israeli occupation, Israel put the town under siege.\nChristian groups around the world attempted to bring humanitarian aid to the city, or just to pay a friendly visit.\nVisitors who were turned away by the Israeli military included the heads of the Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox churches.\n\n## British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nSome men who were sympathetic to the tax resistance campaign of the Women’s Tax Resistance League found that they could participate by exploiting a legal technicality that made \u003Cem>them\u003C/em> responsible for paying their wives’ income taxes.\nIf their wives refused to pay, and the husbands were unable to pay and had no property to seize, the husbands could be imprisoned for not paying their wives’ taxes—and some were (see [an earlier section on the British women’s suffrage movement](../../../tacticsthatsupportresisters/developlegalexpertise/#british-womens-suffrage-movement)).\n\n## American Revolution\n\nAmerican colonial tax resisters used boycotts and other means to try to hurt sales of taxed and British-monopoly products in the colonies.\nIn this way they enlisted as their allies the manufacturers and exporters of Great Britain who begged Parliament to rescind the taxes so as to bring the boycotts to an end.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n*

their impact by encouraging bank runs—that is, by asking people to withdraw their savings from banks.\nThis can be an attempt to reduce the assets available to the government, or to crash the economic system and thereby put pressure on the government more indirectly.\n\nIf the government forbids people from withdrawing their own money, or is unable to meet the sudden demand for currency, the credibility of the banking system is called into question, which can make it difficult for the regime to continue in business.\nOn the other hand, if the government allows people to withdraw their money, and if enough of them do so, this reduces the capital available to the banks, reduces their ability to confidently loan money (for instance, to the government), and can also shake the credibility of the system.\nThe government may respond to such a crisis by further degrading the currency, but the long-term effects of this can also serve to undermine the government.\n\n## Reform Act Agitation\n\nIn the final days of the agitation in the United Kingdom that led to the enacting of the Reform Act 1832, the movement in favor of the Act augmented its tax resistance campaign with a run on the Bank of England.\nLondon awoke one morning to find that the resistance movement had plastered the walls of the city with posters reading “\u003Cem>Go for Gold!\u003C/em>”\nAbout £1.8 million in gold was withdrawn from the Bank of England in the first days of the campaign (out of roughly £7 million in the Bank’s possession).\nSome commentators believe this to have been the turning point in the campaign.\nThe King soon invited Earl Grey to form a government with the authority to pass the Reform Act into law.\n\n## Anti-Czarists\n\nIn 1905, Russian socialists issued a manifesto

resistance campaigns have sometimes amplified their impact by encouraging bank runs—that is, by asking people to withdraw their savings from banks.\nThis can be an attempt to reduce the assets available to the government, or to crash the economic system and thereby put pressure on the government more indirectly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If the government forbids people from withdrawing their own money, or is unable to meet the sudden demand for currency, the credibility of the banking system is called into question, which can make it difficult for the regime to continue in business.\nOn the other hand, if the government allows people to withdraw their money, and if enough of them do so, this reduces the capital available to the banks, reduces their ability to confidently loan money (for instance, to the government), and can also shake the credibility of the system.\nThe government may respond to such a crisis by further degrading the currency, but the long-term effects of this can also serve to undermine the government.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"reform-act-agitation\">Reform Act Agitation\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In the final days of the agitation in the United Kingdom that led to the enacting of the Reform Act 1832, the movement in favor of the Act augmented its tax resistance campaign with a run on the Bank of England.\nLondon awoke one morning to find that the resistance movement had plastered the walls of the city with posters reading “\u003Cem>Go for Gold!\u003C/em>”\nAbout £1.8 million in gold was withdrawn from the Bank of England in the first days of the campaign (out of roughly £7 million in the Bank’s possession).\nSome commentators believe this to have been the turning point in the campaign.\nThe King soon invited Earl Grey to form a government with the

resistance.",[],{"order":598,"hidden":39,"attrs":1713},{},"The influential Ayn Rand novel \u003Ci>Atlas Shrugged\u003C/i> is in large part a fantasy in which the entrepreneurial wealth-creators in the United States quietly go on strike, one at a time, until the government finds itself with less and less to take and has to resort to increasingly desperate (and eventually fruitless) measures to try to stay afloat.\nRand’s working title for the novel was “The Strike.”\nBut strikes by business people are not only a thing of fiction.\n\nBusiness strikes can add emphasis to a tax strike.\nThey also, by reducing the base of taxable commercial transactions, can be a form of tax resistance.\n\n## India\n\nIn 1810 in Benares, the British imperial government tried to impose a house tax.\nThe residents responded with a \u003Ci>hartal\u003C/i>, or general strike:\n“the shops were closed, every kind of occupation was abandoned… a solemn engagement was taken by all the inhabitants to carry on no manner of work or business until the tax was repealed.\nEverything was at a stand:\nthe dead bodies were cast unceremoniously into the river, because there were none to perform the obsequial rites; and the very thieves refrained from the exercise of their vocation…”\nThe extended \u003Ci>hartal\u003C/i> was successful, and the Raj dropped the offensive tax.\n\nThe later Indian independence movement frequently used \u003Ci>hartals\u003C/i> and strikes, sometimes in coordination with tax resistance tactics such as the salt raids.\nDuring the Bardoli tax strike, for example, shopkeepers frequently shut down their operations whenever officials came to town, and hartals sometimes broke out spontaneously on other occasions.\n\n## Bob Williams\n\nWhen American farmer Bob Williams was filling out his tax return in 2008, he reflected on the “bombs and bullets” that his tax dollars would help to pay for.\n“I thought, ‘This is terrible, I don’t want to open,’ Why should I make this extra money?”\nHe decided that from then on, he would donate all of his produce to charity rather than sell it for taxable income.\n\n## Palestine\n\nDuring the first intifada in Palestine, the Unified National Command responded to a crackdown on the tax strikers of Beit Sahour by calling “an unprecedented five day in six general strike,” while “[s]torekeepers in the town launched a commercial strike that lasted three months…”\nThe Israeli practice of seizing equipment, supplies, and goods from businesses that refused to remit taxes also had the effect of putting those businesses into a state of strike whether or not that was their intention.\n\nIn 1981, in support of Palestinian doctors who were refusing to pay an Israeli income tax, shopkeepers in Gaza City launched multiple two-day strikes.\n\n## Ruhrkampf\n\nIn the Ruhr, during the French/Belgian occupation of 1923, businesses shut down rather than pay reparation taxes:\n\n> The owners of the German coal mines and foundries in the Ruhr are determined not to pay the 10 per cent. export tax imposed on coal by the French… The owners will refuse to export an ounce of coal or coke. They will dump the supplies in the yards, and are prepared for a long siege.\n\nThis was accompanied by a large-scale labor strike, which the German government helped by giving direct financial support to the individual strikers.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Mill, James & Wilson, Horace H. \u003Ci>The History of British India\u003C/i>, Vol. I (1848) pp. 466–67\n* Desai, Mahadev \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i> (1929) pp. 111–12, 187\n* Dietz, Alison “Farmer Donates Produce to Protest War” \u003Ci>The Chronicle-Telegram\u003C/i> 13 August 2008\n* Rigby, Andrew “The tax war” \u003Ci>Living the Intifada\u003C/i> (1991)\n* “Gaza City Begins Strike Over Tax on Doctors” Associated Press (as found in \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i>) 6 December 1981\n* “Resistance of Mine Owners” \u003Ci>Northern Times\u003C/i> 17 March 1923\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/docs/tacticsthatexpandthearsenaloftechniques/hartalsandbusinessstrikes.md","d2b67eba1b73caff",{"html":1718,"metadata":1719},"\u003Cp>The influential Ayn Rand novel \u003Ci>Atlas Shrugged\u003C/i> is in large part a fantasy in which the entrepreneurial wealth-creators in the United States quietly go on strike, one at a time, until the government finds itself with less and less to take and has to resort to increasingly desperate (and eventually fruitless) measures to try to stay afloat.\nRand’s working title for the novel was “The Strike.”\nBut strikes by business people are not only a thing of fiction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Business strikes can add emphasis to a tax strike.\nThey also, by reducing the base of taxable commercial transactions, can be a form of tax resistance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"india\">India\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In 1810 in Benares, the British imperial government tried to impose a house tax.\nThe residents responded with a \u003Ci>hartal\u003C/i>, or general strike:\n“the shops were closed, every kind of occupation was abandoned… a solemn engagement was taken by all the inhabitants to carry on no manner of work or business until the tax was repealed.\nEverything was at a stand:\nthe dead bodies were cast unceremoniously into the river, because there were none to perform the obsequial rites; and the very thieves refrained from the exercise of their vocation…”\nThe extended \u003Ci>hartal\u003C/i> was successful, and the Raj dropped the offensive tax.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The later Indian independence movement frequently used \u003Ci>hartals\u003C/i> and strikes, sometimes in coordination with tax resistance tactics such as the salt raids.\nDuring the Bardoli tax strike, for example, shopkeepers frequently shut down their operations whenever officials came to town, and hartals sometimes broke out spontaneously on other occasions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"bob-williams\">Bob Williams\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>When American farmer Bob Williams was filling out his tax return in 2008, he reflected on the “bombs and bullets” that his tax dollars would help to pay for.\n“I thought, ‘This is terrible, I don’t want to open,’ Why should I make this extra money?”\nHe decided that from then on, he would donate all of his produce to charity rather than sell it for taxable income.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"palestine\">Palestine\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>During the first intifada in Palestine, the Unified National Command responded to a crackdown on the tax strikers of Beit Sahour by calling “an unprecedented five day in six general strike,” while “[s]torekeepers in the town launched a commercial strike that lasted three months…”\nThe Israeli practice of seizing equipment, supplies, and goods from businesses that refused to remit taxes also had the effect of putting those businesses into a state of strike whether or not that was their intention.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 1981, in support of Palestinian doctors who were refusing to pay an Israeli income tax, shopkeepers in Gaza City launched multiple two-day strikes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"ruhrkampf\">Ruhrkampf\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In the Ruhr, during the French/Belgian occupation of 1923, businesses shut down rather than pay reparation taxes:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The owners of the German coal mines and foundries in the Ruhr are determined not to pay the 10 per cent. export tax imposed on coal by the French… The owners will refuse to export an ounce of coal or coke.

with Labor Strikes","Some tax resistance campaigns have included labor strikes.",[],{"order":452,"hidden":39,"attrs":1764},{},"Some tax resistance campaigns have included labor strikes that restrict government resources, demonstrate solidarity, and free up the time of resisters so they can put more work into the campaign.\nIn some cases, these strikes are themselves a form of tax resistance—reducing the income or sales tax base by reducing the amount of income earned or sales made.\n\nA strike can deprive a government of funds, and can thereby work in harmony with a tax strike that is being used as a nonviolent resistance tactic.\nFor example, a tax strike in 2003 aimed at Hugo Chavez’s government in Venezuela was accompanied by a multi-week labor strike that “bled the Chavez government’s economic lifeline”—the state-run oil industry—“costing it millions of dollars a day.”\n\nGandhi led a strike of Indian miners in South Africa in 1913 in protest against a poll tax on Indian immigrants.\nHundreds of strikers were arrested during the course of the strike, which eventually drew in participants from “harbour, corporation, and railway employees, as well as the drivers, cooks, waiters, and messengers.”\nIt succeeded in forcing the government to rescind the tax.\n\nSlave laborers in several prisons in the American state of Georgia went on strike in 2010, refusing to work to contribute to the profit of the prison system.\nThey coordinated their daring strike between the prisons by using contraband cell phones.\n“We’re hearing in the news that they’re putting it down as a prison riot, so [the authorities say they] locked the prison down,” one striker said.\nNot true: “We locked ourselves down.”\n\nA strike can also be used as an additional pressure tactic in a campaign to have a tax abolished.\nIn the U.S. city of Savannah, Georgia, in 1867, the government tried to impose a $10 tax on “stevedores and other laborers on the wharves.”\nThe workers refused to pay and the city locked them out of the wharves.\n\n> This, of course, seriously interfered with the shipping interests of the city, and the Council, finding that the laborers were not at all disposed to yield, and that meanwhile the “strike” was damaging the business community to the amount of thousands of dollars, and was driving all the vessels from this to other ports, met and

resistance campaigns have accompanied their resistance with petitions to the government asking it to change its policies or to rescind the tax.\n\n## Petitions as Hopeful Requests\n\nEvery once in a while, there is hope that the petition itself may lead to a change in government policy.\n\nDuring the 17th century Croquant tax rebellions in France, the rebels sent carefully flattering petitions to the king that purported to assume, since the king was so wise and good, that the offensive tax hikes must have been snuck past his royal highness by deceitful advisors.\n\nIn 1723, religious nonconformists in Massachusetts successfully petitioned the King to free colonists who had been imprisoned for resisting a tax designed to fund the establishment church, and to affirm that Quakers in the colony should not have to pay taxes to maintain the ministers of another church.\n\nAfrican-American entrepreneur Paul Cuffee petitioned the Massachusetts legislature in 1780 and 1781 to complain that he was not permitted to vote, although he was a taxpayer (he also backed up his complaint by refusing to pay).\nHis petition arrived at a time when the state Constitution was in flux, and may have helped influence its drafters to omit a clause that would have restricted voting to white citizens.\n\nThe Rebecca Rioters, with their pseudonymous campaign of midnight toll-gate destruction, had the government nearly begging them to present a list of grievances they could at least pretend to address.\nMany groups of Welsh farmers did meet and draft lists of grievances.\nOnce, a \u003Ci>London Times\u003C/i> reporter gained the confidence of a Rebeccaite assembly, and then he set out their grievances for them in the form of a \u003Ci>Times\u003C/i> article describing the meeting.\nAnother group of farmers drafted a petition of their grievances that they sent to a government representative via a trusted intermediary.\nOn at least one occasion a group of parishes had petitioned the Turnpike Trust that ran one of the offending toll gates, asking them to remove it, before Rebecca and her daughters took matters into their own hands.\n\nDuring the Annuity Tax struggle in Edinburgh, Scotland, “40,000 citizens of Edinburgh petitioned the House of Commons for [the Tax’s] abolition.\nThe town council, the magistrates of Canongate, the Merchant Company, the Anti-state-church and the Anti-annuity-tax Associations, all exerted themselves with the legislature and the government to procure its repeal, but all their influence was thwarted and set at nought, by the preposterous demands and unjust claims of the clergy.”\n\n## Petitions as Part of Larger Protests\n\nSome 14,000 American Amish petitioned Congress, putting aside that sect’s usual reluctance to participate in political affairs and asking the government to exempt them from the Social Security program, participation in which they felt was anti-Christian.\nAt the same time, some Amish were actively resisting the tax and suffering from government reprisals.\nCongress eventually did carve out an exemption for the Amish and certain other sects.\n\nThe Benares \u003Ci>hartal\u003C/i> of 1810–11 was successful in forcing the government to rescind a house tax.\nWhen it began, the residents of Benares abandoned the city and set up camp in an open field between Benares and Secrole, where the British administration was headquartered.\nThere, “[a] petition was presented to the magistrate, praying him to withdraw the odious impost, and declaring that the petitioners would never return to their homes until their application was complied with.”\n\n## Petitions that Open Negotiations\n\nBefore launching the Bardoli tax strike, representatives from the resistance movement petitioned the government, asking for the concessions they would later demand via satyagraha.\n\n## Petitions as Propaganda Opportunities\n\nAbby Smith addressed the Glastonbury town council in 1873 to explain why she would not be paying her property tax to politicians who took advantage of her voteless condition.\nThe address fell on deaf ears in the council, but a newspaper published the text of her speech, and commented that “Abby Smith and her sister as truly stand for the American principle as did the citizens who ripped open the tea chests in Boston Harbor, or the farmers who leveled their muskets at Concord.”\nSoon the Smith case became a \u003Ci>cause célèbre\u003C/i> nationwide.\n\n## Petitions that Forewarn the Opponent\n\nThe hut tax war in Sierra Leone was preceded by petitions from a variety of groups asking the government to rescind the tax and explaining why the tax was felt to be particularly offensive.\nIn this case, the petitioning may have made things worse, as the government stubbornly pushed forward with the tax, but, because it was forewarned of opposition by the petitions, it “came to the conclusion that the exercise of force, peremptory, rapid, and inflexible, was the element to be relied on in making the scheme of taxation a success.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Rothbard, Murray

Generally a crape streamer is hoisted at the flagstaff, and the Mayor burns his official sash in public.\n\n## The Boekes\n\nWar tax resisters Beatrice and Cornelis Boeke felt that in order for their tax resistance to be consistent, they must also refuse to use state-run monopolies like the postal service and railways, relinquish their passports, stop contributing to retirement accounts, and renounce any claim to the protection of the police, courts, and military.\nWhen the government started providing funding even for private schools, they withdrew their children and home-schooled them.\nThey even stopped handling government-issued currency.\nThey took this so far that they abandoned their home rather than call the police when vagrants moved in.\n\n## Tasmania\n\nIn Tasmania, in 1874, 26 magistrates resigned their offices rather than try to enforce a widely-resisted tax.\n\n> Such an expressive demonstration on the part of gentlemen holding the commission of the peace incited the people to stronger resistance; for it appeared to them that a law which could not be conscientiously administered by the retiring justices was unworthy of obedience.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Gandhi, M.K. “On Non-Violence” \u003Ci>Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha)\u003C/i> (1961) pp. 358–61\n* Gandhi, M.K. “Speech at Public Meeting, Banaras—26 November 1920” \u003Ci>The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi\u003C/i>, Vol. 22, pp. 18–19\n* “India Urged to Refuse to Pay Taxes to British” \u003Ci>The New York Call\u003C/i> 9 April 1921, p. 1\n* Desai, Mahadev \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i> (1929) pp. 159, 184\n* “Gandhi Urged Calm Should He Be Seized” \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> 12 March 1922\n* Rhode Island Yearly Meeting “Not Consistent to Receive Military Pensions” \u003Ci>American Quaker War Tax Resistance\u003C/i>, 2nd ed.

They had to find out where people worked. This was a real nightmare because other than asking the people concerned, they had no real way of getting the information they needed. When a liability order was granted by the court, non-payers were sent a form which requested details of employment. Failure to fill it out carried a fine of £100 and £400 if the non-payer provided false information. But this didn’t act as a deterrent either, because, if people couldn’t pay the Poll Tax itself (and the court costs which were added), then it made little difference if the council added another £100. A survey carried out by the Audit Commission in late 1989 showed that, nationally, only 15% of people who received the form actually sent it back. Like electoral registration, it was widely ignored even though this was a criminal offence.\n\n![licensed from William Murphy under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 license](../../../assets/dont-register-dont-pay.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>non-registration is key to the Household Tax resistance campaign\u003C/figcaption>\n\n## Household Tax Resistance\n\nThe Household Tax resistance movement in Ireland is characterized by the refusal of households to register to pay the tax.\n\n> This is not a charge to fund your local community, it is a tax to fund private speculators, bondholders, and the bailout. Our incomes and services are being decimated to pay this private debt. Now people have a chance to register their opposition by not registering for this tax. By not registering, we can make this a referendum on the bailouts for the rich and the cuts for us.\n\nOnly about half of Irish households had registered by the legal deadline at the end of March, 2012.\nRuth Coppinger of the Campaign Against Household and Water Taxes declared victory:\n\n> This is more than was achieved by Poll Tax non-payment which started off at 15% in the first year, 1989, and which only reached 45% boycott in the year of its abolition.\n\n## Episcopalians in Scotland\n\nThe official church of Scotland had a habit through the centuries of taxing everyone in Scotland for its support, even members of rival churches.\nThis annoyed people who preferred another denomination.\nAnd this annoyance became especially loud whenever the “official” church changed.\n\nWhen the Presbyterians succeeded the Episcopalians as the church of record in 1688, one way the Episcopalians resisted was by refusing to pay the tax and refusing to participate in a church-run census.\nWilliam Maitland, in his \u003Ci>History of Edinburgh\u003C/i>, fretted over difficulties in estimating the population at this period of time, noting:\n\n> [T]he greatest Defect is owing to the Episcopalian Inhabitants, who, being of a different Communion from the established Church, are not subject to the Controul and Examination of its Ministers; wherefore, many of them refuse to give Accounts either of the Names or Numbers of Persons in their Familities.\n\n## Queensland Water Tax Strike\n\nIn Queensland, Australia, in 1926, the government tried to sneak a tax on farmers who used wells or water pumps to irrigate their lands.\nThe farmers rebelled.\n\nSince the tax took the form of a stiff fee that accompanied the mandatory registration of such wells or water pumps, it was natural that the tax resistance included mass refusal to register.\nLocal Producers’ Associations across Queensland gathered and voted to refuse registration.\n\nA month after the tax went into effect, facing this campaign of mass refusal, the government backed down and rescinded the tax… but it did not eliminate the requirement to register wells and water pumps, which was the pretext the tax had been hooked onto.\nSome Associations were suspicious, and continued to counsel their members to refuse to register even after their tax resistance victory.\nA Mr. Roome of the Woodmillar LPA put it this way:\n\n> A lot of farmers were under the impression that because [the] registration fee had been withdrawn, everything in the garden was lovely. But the regulations were still there, and farmers who were under that impression would receive a rude awakening. Only formal registration had to be made, but they would find that if they furnished the particulars asked for they would give the Government an opportunity to later on impose the charges. The danger was still there, whereas if they refused to register the onus was on the Government to get the particulars, and prove that the farmers put down wells or sunk dams, etc. Once they gave the information they were at the mercy of the Government.… The excuse by the Government was that they wanted to get a survey of the water facilities which was absolutely ridiculous. The whole thing was a farce, and an excuse to impose a tax. The only way was to refuse to register, which he hoped would be done by members of all branches, and also refuse to pay the tax.\n\nThe Association passed a resolution encouraging its members to continue to refuse to register.\n\n## Boycotting “Count Days”\n\nIn the United States, school districts often get government funding based on how many students are in attendance on certain “count days.”\nThe more students are at school on those days, the more money the district can get from the various governments that provide school funding.\nDistricts do a lot to try to increase attendance on “count days” for this reason—stunts like bringing elephants to campus, giving away gift bags, holding ice cream socials, and hosting carnival rides at school.\nBut one parent, Carrie Klauber of Colorado, decided to use this as leverage, saying she would keep her children home from school on count days, and thereby deprive the district of money, to try to push her district to adopt better policies.\n\n## Census Resistance in Fiji\n\nFiji initiated a poll tax on indentured workers from India in 1924.\nThe Indians had no political representation on the island, were banned from the schools, and could only emigrate on a single ship voyage offered once per year: they were essentially considered disposable migrant labor.\nThe workers thought that this new tax, which amounted to 12 days’ pay, was a sort of bait-and-switch on the contracts that had brought them to Fiji, and so they vowed to resist.\nAs one account put it:\n\n> A start will be made in January to register all those liable to pay the residential tax, and prison will be the fate of him who does not comply with the law. Leading Indians in every district declare that they will willingly go to gaol before they register their names, and a general passive resistance is highly possible, with all its attendant strikes and bitter feeling.\n\n## The British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n![](../../../assets/votes-for-women.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>a 1911 census form filled out as a protest\u003C/figcaption>\n\nThe women’s suffrage movement in the United Kingdom, more so than anywhere else, used tax resistance in its struggle.\nSuffragists also resisted government attempts to get information from them, both because these attempts were part of the effort to tax them, and because the laws that governed such information-gathering had been passed by a male-exclusive government.\n\nIn 1910, Winifred Patch wrote:\n\n> I have recently received a paper from the Inland Revenue Office headed “Duties on Land Values. Notice to Furnish Information,” asking for the names and addresses of any persons to whom I pay rent or for whom I may collect rents, a penalty not exceeding £50 being incurred if this information is wilfully withheld.… As I am denied the rights of citizenship I absolutely decline to facilitate in any way the carrying out of the provisions of Mr. Lloyd George’s Finance Bill, and am returning my paper with this written across it. I am hoping, through the Women’s Tax Resistance League, of which I am a member, to obtain expert information which will enable me to make it impossible for the Government to exact the £50 penalty, and will leave them with no alternative but to imprison me in default. Will other women join me in making this protest? I feel that there must be many like myself who would gladly risk imprisonment for the cause, but who, for various reasons, find it very difficult, if not impossible, to take part in the more active protests which have hitherto brought women into conflict with the law. I cannot help hoping that we have here another vantage ground from which to attack a Government which refuses us justice.\n\nTeresa Billington-Grieg took up Patch’s suggestion and rallied the troops:\n\n> The famous forms on which the owners and lease-holders of the country have to prepare the necessary statistics for the levying of the new [land] tax have been issued now in practically all parts of England, and they will be issued in Scotland within a few days. Already these forms have been returned unfilled up, and with a curt comment as to the status of the women applied to, by some of our members in England. They will be so returned by many Suffragists across the border. Neither information nor money will be forthcoming in response to the Inland Revenue Department’s demands. As far as possible this piece of Government business will be impeded first by the determined refusal of information, and, second, by the withholding of the money claimed in taxes.\n> \n> Such refusal to yield to tyranny is always desirable. But at the present moment it carries an additional value in that it can be employed to improve the chances of the Conciliation Women’s Suffrage Bill. From now until the fate of the Bill is decided, every woman to whom any Government application for information or for taxes is made should not only refuse to comply because of the unrepresented condition of her sex, but should add a rider to the effect that she will gladly supply information and provide the money claimed if the Women’s Suffrage Bill at present before Parliament becomes law this Session.\n\nMargarete Wynne Nevinson put it this way:\n\n> Here I have one of Mr. Lloyd George’s wonderful forms, with its numerous questions, to answer which intelligently I should require, apparently, the training of a lawyer and surveyor, and a fund of universal knowledge which I do not possess. I am asked to answer those questions, but am not considered fit to vote for a member of Parliament. This Form is addressed to me because I have a little freehold property, but it starts off with “Sir.” I am sending it back, pointing our that I must be addressed as “Madam,” and not “Sir,” and that as I have not vote, I do not see what this matter has to do with me. If you think of it, it is rather an insult to all women property holders to be addressed as “Sir,” and not by their proper title of courtesy. The State seems to take for granted that there can be no free women or women freeholders in the country, but that all the land must be owned by men.\n\nThe following year, Charlotte Despard announced that this strategy of non-cooperation would be extended to the national census. One news account said:\n\n> The census would cost a great deal of money, said Mrs. Despard, and involve an enormous amount of labor. So far as they were concerned, this census should not be taken.\n>\n> “We shall prove,” said Mrs. Despard, “whether there is a people, or whether there can be a people without the women.

People in Legal Tax Avoidance Techniques","Some tax resistance campaigns teach pragmatic tax strategies that would not be out of place in run-of-the-mill financial planning workshops.",[],{"order":1096,"hidden":39,"attrs":2191},{},"If you resist taxes because you want to reduce the financial resources available to the government, it may not matter to you whether you do this through illegal civil disobedience or through legal tax reduction strategies.\nFor this reason, some tax resistance campaigns have taught pragmatic tax strategies that would not be out of place in run-of-the-mill financial planning workshops.\nHere are some examples:\n\nDuring a sales tax strike in Ontario in 1981, the accounting firm Deloitte Haskins and Sells Canada (an ancestor of today’s enormous Deloitte professional services firm) published a booklet that described several ways that people could legally avoid the sales tax, including “such tips as buying large children’s clothing for small-sized adults or buying baby skin care products as substitutes for adult versions” (products intended for children evidently being exempt from the tax).\n\nIn 1973 a group of war tax resisters in Boston, Massachusetts, opened a tax consulting service called “Common Sense” that “drew on the expertise of trained tax accountants to provide two services: counseling for tax resisters and aid to anyone in preparing tax forms… Clients often were poor or working-class people.\nMany were helped to avoid tax overpayments, and a large degree of friendly communication was established.”\n\nToday in the United States, about 40% of households pay no federal income tax, legally, because their incomes are sufficiently low or their deductions and credits are sufficiently high.\nSome tax resisters there successfully resist the income tax by deliberately joining this 40%—they learn how to take advantage of deductions and credits so that they can earn enough to support themselves without earning so much that the government wants its cut.\n\nAn IRS-sponsored program called “Volunteer Income Tax Assistance” enlists and trains volunteers to help people—typically people with low incomes—to fill out their income tax returns.\nThe great majority of returns filed through this program result in refunds rather than additional payments (at a ratio of about 15:1), so

We were able to interject some information about where that money really goes—and to offer some alternatives… about how people can withdraw their own complicity.”\n\nHere are some of the many examples of how war tax resisters have used tax day as a creative outreach opportunity:\n\n* On tax day in 1966 Ken Knudson highlighted the connection between conscription and taxation by burning a check made out to the IRS while standing in front of the IRS office in Madison, Wisconsin, in much the same way as protesting conscripts were burning their draft registration cards.\n* Around tax day in 1982, war tax resister Ralph Dull filled up his truck with 325 bushels of corn and delivered these to the IRS office in lieu of his tax payment. He said that his unusual form of payment symbolized “the need for the United States government to balance the budget by not cutting human services but by reducing military spending by at least $100 billion.”\n* Two dozen war tax resisters in St. Louis, Missouri, propagandized taxpayers on tax day in 2003 by creating their own tax forms. These featured a ghostly photo of an Iraqi child who had been wounded in the U.S. war on Iraq superimposed over the usual grid of an income tax form. They then placed these forms alongside the ones that taxpayers would pick up to fill out their returns.\n* The following year, I joined a group of war tax resisters in Oakland, California, and helped to enact a skit about taxes and war. I played the part of an IRS agent and chided the crowd of protesters:\n  > “You seem like politically-savvy people.

resisting.",[],{"order":276,"hidden":39,"attrs":2293},{},"If you can convince influential organizations to endorse tax resistance or to recommend that their members begin resisting, this can be a great boost to your campaign.\nHere are a few examples:\n\n## Queensland’s LPAs\n\nAn existing network of “Local Producers’ Associations” was crucial to the mass-adoption of tax resistance by agriculturalists in Queensland, Australia, in 1927 and to the success of their tax resistance campaign.\nThe Associations used their preexisting communication and organizing infrastructure to call meetings, create an information-sharing network across Queensland, and coordinate policies.\nThis allowed them to put forward a bold and united tax resistance front so quickly and convincingly that their campaign succeeded in convincing the government to rescind its water tax after only a month.\n\n## The British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nThe women’s suffrage movement in the United Kingdom was not unified.\nThere were tactical, ideological, and personal divides that fragmented the movement into several groups.\nThe Women’s Freedom League was an early adopter of the tactic of tax resistance, in 1908, and in 1909 it spun off a sub-group—the Women’s Tax Resistance League—devoted to that tactic.\nThis spin-off group tried to be ecumenical, accepting into its ranks activists from various factions, and trying in turn to spread the tactic of tax resistance to the various groups that made up the suffrage movement.\nThe gambit worked:\nIn 1910 they won the endorsement of the Women’s Social and Political Union, and in 1913 that of the Federated Council of Suffrage Societies.\n\n## Quakers\n\nSince the founding of the Society of Friends, it had a policy of instructing members to refuse to pay government-mandated tithes to rival churches.\nThis policy of refusal to pay for things that offend God soon extended to war tax resistance.\nQuakers were instructed not to pay taxes for “drums, colors, or for other warlike uses” and not to pay fines that the government assessed for their refusal to participate in the military.\n\nQuaker meetings would codify policies like these in a book of “discipline.”\nAny Quakers who deviated from these policies would be subject to a process of correction, or, if they continued to defy the policy, “disowning” (something akin to excommunication).\nHere is one example of a Quaker policy on war tax resistance, from the rules of discipline of the Rhode Island Yearly Meeting:\n\n> It is the concern of this meeting, to recommend to the several monthly meetings, that they, consistently with our ancient testimony, refuse the payment of all taxes, expressly or specially for the support of war, whether called for in money, provisions, or otherwise… and that such friends as do actively pay such taxes, be dealt with as disorderly walkers.\n\nSuch rules of discipline might change over time, and could differ from meeting to meeting.\nHeated argument might break out about how strict a standard of tax resistance Quakers should be held to.\nThis frequent debate helped to maintain awareness of tax resistance in the Society.\n\n## Peace Churches\n\nIn 1978 three American “peace church” denominations—Quakers, Brethren, and Mennonites—issued a rare joint statement that called for war tax resistance among their 350,000 church members, and asked their congregations to “uphold war tax resisters with spiritual, emotional, legal, and material support.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and

It wants to divide the democrats; it wants to make the peasants and workers count themselves as non-payers owing to lack of means to pay, in order to split them from those not paying out of regard for legality, and thereby deprive the latter of the support of the former. But this plan will fail; the people realizes that it is responsible for solidarity in the refusal to pay taxes, just as previously it was responsible for solidarity in payment of them.\n\n## Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nDuring the Bardoli tax strike, the government tried to exploit a variety of possible wedges:\nSome villages in the district were relatively unharmed by recent tax increases, while others bore the brunt.\nEthnicity, religion, occupation, and caste were other possible dividing lines.\nThe government at times tried to insist that “outside agitators” were coming in from the nationalist movement to usurp the local struggle for their own ends.\n\nThere was also a divide in interests and risks between land-owners and the peasants who rented and worked the land:\n\n> The two sections of apparently conflicting interests were those who tilled the land and those who let it out. The latter had great stakes, and unless they stood by the petty tenants, the struggle would fizzle out.\n\nStrike commander Vallabhbhai Patel visited these landlords and tried to convince them to maintain solidarity with the strike.\nHe told them that the government was blaming the recent tax hikes that had led to the strikes on the landlords’ rent increases which, by the government’s reasoning, demonstrated that the land had become more valuable and that a higher tax was justified:\n\n> The sole ground on which the assessment has been enhanced is the rise in the rental value of land, and whether that rise is real or unreal, you are responsible for it. It is for your sins that the whole \u003Ci>taluka\u003C/i> [district] is suffering, and the least penance that you owe to them is to stand by them. Will you be loyal to the \u003Ci>sarkar\u003C/i> [government] or to the tillers of the soil? What is it that binds you to the \u003Ci>sarkar\u003C/i>? Payment of taxation. But what binds you to the peasants is a living bond. It is their toil on which you live and carry on your trade. If they are ruined, where will you be? Do not be false to your mainstay.\n\n## The Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca movement in Wales was very successful in its bold campaign, but it was weakened by tactics that alienated potential supporters.\n\nIn the Rebecca Riots, bands of disguised people, who followed leaders to whom they gave the pseudonym “Rebecca,” gathered in the dead of night to destroy toll booths all across Wales.\n\nBut the diffuse, non-hierarchical, anonymous structure of the movement made it vulnerable to people who wanted to hijack it for their own ends.\nPeople and groups calling themselves “Rebecca” began issuing threats and enacting vigilante justice in a variety of causes, or sometimes in what seemed like merely personal grievances.\n\nFor example, after Rebecca and her sisters came to the aid of farmers by reducing the tolls they were charged when bringing their goods to market, another meeting of Rebeccaites decided they were therefore justified in demanding that these newly-liberated farmers and merchants lower the prices of their goods.\nButter and beer would now be cheaper in Wales, and the Rebeccaites would see to it—by force if necessary.\n\nThings like this made the message of the movement confused, made it less sympathetic to potential supporters, and helped the authorities to recruit spies and people willing to testify against the rioters from among those who otherwise might have been their allies.\n\n## The British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nWhen the Women’s Tax Resistance League and allied organizations were trying to win the vote for women, most men couldn’t vote in Britain either.\nThe right to vote at the time was largely restricted to propertied men, though there were ongoing campaigns for universal male suffrage that were hoping to change this.\n\nBecause much of the women’s movement at the time was trying to get women to be treated equally as voters under the law, it was, therefore, fighting merely for the voting rights of propertied women, not for women in general.\n\nMovement activist Dora Montefiore reflected on this, and the divisions it threatened to provoke:\n\n> …the Members of the Social Democratic Federation, of which I was a member, were very scornful because they said we should have been asking at that moment for Adult Suffrage and not Votes for Women; but although I have always been a staunch adult suffragist, I felt that at that moment the question of the enfranchisement of women was paramount, as we had to educate the public in our demands and in the reasons for our demands, and as we found that with many people the words “Adult Suffrage” connoted only manhood suffrage, our urgent duty was at that moment to gain Press publicity up and down the country and to popularise the idea of the political enfranchisement of women.\n>\n> I explained in all my speeches and writings that though it looked as if I were only asking for Suffrage for Women on a property qualification, I was doing this because the mass of non-qualified women could not demonstrate in the same way, and I was to that extent their spokeswoman.… The working women from the East End came, time and again, to demonstrate in front of my barricaded house and understood this point and never swerved in their allegiance to our organisation.\n\n## Poll Tax Resistance\n\nThere were frequent tensions in the campaign against Thatcher’s poll tax between the locally-organized grassroots groups that were the real engine of the revolt, and the professional left/labor radical groups and politicians who kept trying to put themselves at the front of the parade.\n\nWhen a number of people were arrested in a police riot during an anti-poll tax demonstration at Trafalgar Square, some of the movement leadership distanced themselves from those who had been arrested in the riot—they wanted to distinguish nonviolent tax resisters from those people who were charged with resisting arrest or other such charges.\nThey even went so far as to talk about holding “an internal inquiry” to “root out the troublemakers.”\nBut when the defendants in these cases organized their own collective defense committee, the leaders of the All-Britain Federation tried to appropriate their momentum by launching its own rival defense fund and soliciting donations (that attempt failed).\n\n## Left-Right Coalitions\n\nThere have been some attempts at coalition building between tax-sensitive activists on the left and right in the United States (where the folks at the top keep the folks at the bottom facing off against each other across the left-right divide so their pockets face outwards and are easier to pick).\n\nThe National Taxpayers Union held a “tea party” in 1970 at which right-leaning libertarians like Murray Rothbard and Karl Hess, and leftish war tax resisters like Bradford Lyttle spoke.\nThe following year, leftist scholar and war tax resister Noam Chomsky and conservative publisher Robert Kephart shared the stage at a National Taxpayers Union event.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Marx, Karl “On the Proclamation of the Brandenburg-Manteuffel Ministry about Tax Refusal” \u003Ci>Neue Rheinische Zeitung\u003C/i> No. 149, 22 November 1848, as translated in \u003Ci>Marx-Engels Collected Works\u003C/i>, Volume 8, p. 47\n* Desai, Mahadev \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i> (1929) p. 169\n* Montefiore, Dora “Women Must Vote for the Laws They Obey and the Taxes They Pay” \u003Ci>From a Victorian to a Modern\u003C/i> (1925)\n* Burns, Danny \u003Ci>Poll Tax Rebellion\u003C/i> AK Press (1992), pp. 105–108\n* Brotschol, John “Reflections in a Polluted River” \u003Ci>The Abolitionist\u003C/i> November 1970\n* Furgurson, Ernest B. “Finding Out Who ‘Really’ Spends Your Tax Money” \u003Ci>St. Petersburg Times\u003C/i> 7 April 1971\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/docs/tacticsthatincreasethenumberofresisters/maintainsolidarity.md","696b2b75a3b5d54f",{"html":2345,"metadata":2346},"\u003Cp>Many successful tax resistance campaigns have had to confront the challenge of divisions in the movement.\nSometimes such divisions spring from deliberate divide-and-conquer tactics by those who oppose the campaign.\nOther times they are simply fractures in an unstable coalition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If a campaign can maintain and demonstrate solidarity in the face of such challenges, this can be crucial to its ability to recruit and retain resisters.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"german-democrats\">German Democrats\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In mid-19th century Germany, the aristocracy tried to break a tax resistance movement by offering to moderate the government’s enforcement efforts against people who could show that they had limited means.\nKarl Marx, who was promoting tax resistance at the time, saw this as a divide-and-conquer tactic and counseled people to disregard it:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The intention of the Ministry is only too clear.

considering tax resistance as a “maybe someday” action and a “very well, now’s the time” one.\n\n## Poll Tax Resistance\n\nThe rebellion against Thatcher’s poll tax used a number of creative face-to-face outreach strategies:\n\n* The Aberdeen chapter of the campaign enlisted a local theater group to create a performance about the poll tax. They put on shows in neighborhoods, and afterwards held meetings at which they explained how to resist registration and to set up support groups.\n* Another group went door-to-door distributing a poster that people could put up in their windows that read “No Poll Tax Here.” They then waited to see which households displayed the posters, and they made a second visit to those homes, recruiting enough committed activists this way to form the core of a local group.\n* A film crew shot footage for a documentary about the poll tax rebels in Easton. This became an opportunity for more face-to-face contact among potential activists. Campaign historian Danny Burns recalls:\n  > The film was never shown, but the way the community was engaged in the process of making it is instructive. The film producers wanted a shot of all the doors in the street, opening one by one as the occupants came out of their houses with banners and signs. Charles, the local street rep, went round to people’s houses every evening for a week and explained to them what was wanted. Out of 30 houses in the street (a cul-de-sac) 28 agreed to participate. The street is multi-racial with a fairly wide class mix. It was inspiring to see white working class men standing shoulder to shoulder with Asian women and their kids, holding the same banners and engrossed in conversation. Some of them had never spoken to each other before. The film was made, but more importantly, as [a] result of making it, virtually every one of those households joined the Union, and most still had posters in their windows a year later. People were brought into the campaign, not through a leaflet or a canvasser, but through an interesting activity. They didn’t have to go to the campaign, it came to them.\n\nBoth the poll tax resistance campaign and the later Dublin water charge strikers used door-to-door surveys to good effect as well (see conduct surveys to gauge support).\n\n## The British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nIn 1913, British women’s suffrage activist Marie Lawson launched what she called a “snowball” protest:\na sort of chain letter in which she sent out letters that advocated tax resistance (and that protested on behalf of an imprisoned resister) and that asked the recipients to send the same letter “to at least three friends.”\n\n## U.S. Military Aid Foes\n\nWhen the United States approved a billion-dollar military aid package to the government of Colombia in 2000, the president of the Mennonite Church of Colombia, Peter Stucky, and Ricardo Esquivia, the director of that church’s Justapaz organization and the coordinator of the Evangelical Council of Colombia’s Human Rights and Peace Commission, wrote a letter to their sister churches in the United States.\n\nIn that letter, they explained the disastrous consequences of fueling the civil war and the military wing of the war on drugs in Colombia, and they told how the church there was trying to respond more productively to the crisis.\nThey called on American churches to do their part:\n\n> In reality, the government of the United States, using the taxpayers’ money, is supporting the Colombian government in what we consider to be a negative form. This means that the message arriving from the North to the Colombian people becomes a message of death and destruction. For that reason we are calling the churches in the North to redeem their taxes, on one hand by demanding that the U.S. government invests this money in life-producing projects, and on the other hand by redirecting part of their taxes toward a different project in your community or the world that promotes abundant and dignified life, as our Lord Jesus Christ has commanded us.\n\nThe American Mennonite Central Committee responded by urging taxpayers to redirect their taxes to the Mennonite-run “Taxes for Peace” fund, which would be dedicated that year to peace-building efforts in Colombia.\n(See also [Redirect Resisted Taxes to Charity](../../../tacticsofeducationandpublicrelations/redirecttaxestocharity/).)\n\n## Mennonites in World War I\n\nThis sort of advocacy can be dangerous.\nIn 1918, R.W. Benner, an American Mennonite minister, got worried reports from members of his congregation who were being told in no uncertain terms that they would buy so-called “Liberty Bonds” to support the U.S. war effort, or they would answer for their refusal.\nBenner wrote for advice to his bishop, L.J. Heatwole, who responded by reiterating the position of the church:\n“Do not aid or abet war in any form… Contribute nothing to a fund that is used to run the war machine.”\nHe noted:\n\n> In a number of places where brethren have refused to contribute to the different war funds, outlandish threats have been made and in a few cases have been put into execution—such as, tar and feathering, painting houses yellow, decorating autos and buildings with flags to test them out on their principles of nonresistance.\n\nHeatwole urged his fellow-Mennonites to keep the faith and to embrace this sort of martyrdom like good Christians.\nBenner passed this message along to his flock.\nFor this, both of them were criminally convicted under the Espionage Act.\n(To give you some idea of the railroading involved, Heatwole did not learn that a guilty plea had been submitted on his behalf by “his” court-appointed attorney until after he appeared for the trial!)\n\n## Quakers\n\nLetters, or “epistles,” from tax resisting Quakers to their fellow-Friends were an important way of spreading and maintaining the practice in their Society.\n\nIn 1755 the Quaker-dominated Pennsylvania Assembly granted money “for the King’s use” in response to a request from the crown for funds to help England fight the Seven Years’ War (and its American theater: the French and Indian War).\nThe Assembly decided to raise this money by taxing Pennsylvania colonists.\nAmerican Quakers were of mixed opinions about a tax like this—since the tax was to fund a grant that was vaguely “for the King’s use” was it really a \u003Cem>war\u003C/em> tax that Quakers were obligated to resist, or might the money plausibly be spent on any of a variety of the kingdom’s expenses, in which case it should not bother a Quaker to “give to Caesar”?\n\nJohn Woolman, Anthony Benezet, and several other Quakers addressed a letter to other Friends in which they explained:\n\n> [B]eing painfully apprehensive that the large sum granted by the late Act of Assembly for the king’s use is principally intended for purposes inconsistent with our peaceable testimony, we therefore think that as we cannot be concerned in wars and fightings, so neither ought we to contribute thereto by paying the tax directed by the said Act, though suffering be the consequence of our refusal, which we hope to be enabled to bear with patience.\n\nThis letter was important in putting some meat on the bones of the Quaker peace testimony.\nIt would no longer be enough just to look at the form a tax took, or what the legislature chose to call it, but instead a conscientious Quaker would need to ask with genuine curiosity to what ends the tax money would be spent and whether these ends would be consistent with Quaker teachings.\n\nJoseph Whitall reflected on how thoughtful letters like these helped him maintain his war tax resistance in times of doubt:\n\n> I read with singular satisfaction the piece which you lent me respecting taxes, as it was very strengthening to my mind, which before was somewhat encompassed with weakness on this account.… I have since felt much weakness, and had come to no solid conclusion of mind, until I read your little manuscript, which caused my heart to rejoice, under a feeling sense that it is the truth which leads those who walk and abide in it to hold forth this testimony unto the world. And oh, says my soul, that I may yield faithful obedience to its monitions, let what will be the consequence.\n\n## Lessons from the American War Tax Resistance Movement\n\nA well-crafted and timely personal message can make all the difference in motivating anti-war activists to become war tax resisters.\nI’ve spent some time investigating how the American war tax resistance movement can craft a more persuasive face-to-face recruitment message, and some of my conclusions would be valid for (or have analogies in) a variety of tax resistance campaigns.\n\nAs in sports, there’s an offensive game and a defensive game.\nOffense is knowing what message you want to convey, crafting it well, and deploying it effectively.\nDefense is anticipating questions, understanding the real concerns behind them, having good answers ready, and not getting thrown off-message.\n\nTo craft a motivating message, consider three categories of motivations: \u003Cem>needs\u003C/em>, \u003Cem>fears\u003C/em>, and \u003Cem>values\u003C/em>.\nTo motivate somebody to do something, show them how it will meet their needs (or not interfere with getting their needs met), protect them from something they fear (or not expose them to something frightening), and promote their values (or not require them to violate these values).\n\nWhen the government tries to motivate taxpayers, they rely on fears and values.\nFears of tax audits, criminal penalties, financial troubles, and so forth are important in shaping taxpayer compliance.\nBut it turns out that values are even more important.\n\nIn 2012 the IRS Oversight Board surveyed American taxpayers to ask them what factors were important to them when they decided whether to report their income and pay their taxes.\n40% said that fear of an audit was a very important influence on this decision.\nBut 86% said “personal integrity” was very important (only 4% of those surveyed said integrity was not very or not at all important).\n\nMost American taxpayers pay taxes because they identify taxpaying with honesty, fairness, good citizenship, and their values as a whole.\n\nWar tax resisters offer another path to integrity.\nThe more they speak about how their values motivate them to become tax resisters, the easier it is for people who share those values to imagine themselves as tax resisters.\n\nBut fear is also important.\nWhen NWTRCC surveyed 1,106 anti-war activists who had never done tax resistance before, the #1 reason they gave for why they hadn’t was “Fear legal consequences.”\nAsked what they thought were the two most likely consequences of war tax resistance, 31.6% included jail time (which in reality is extremely rare).\nAsked what they needed most before they would consider resisting, the #1 answer was “Clear idea of likely consequences.”\n\nPeople imagine the consequences of war tax resistance to be much more frightening than they really are.\nThe war tax resistance movement should work hard to dispel this myth, not by saying “tax resistance is perfectly safe” but this:\n\n* There are many methods of war tax resistance, with different levels and types of risk.\n* You can learn the risks in advance and take steps to mitigate them.\n* If you take these steps the risks are much smaller than you might expect.\n* Hardly anyone goes to jail for war tax resistance.\n\nWar tax resisters can also appeal to needs.\nAnti-war activists commonly say they’re tired of going to rallies and marches—they want to do something concrete that has a real, direct effect.\nTax resistance meets this need.\n\nWhen you’re playing defense, you’ll find that some questions come up frequently when tax resistance is discussed.\nThese also concern needs, fears, and values:\n\nIs tax resistance *effective?* (Needs)\n: For instance: “Won’t the government just end up with more money after they add interest and penalties to the tax I resist?” or “How can one person’s refusal make a difference to the vast government budget?”\n\nIs tax resistance *safe?* (Fears)\n: For instance: “Won’t they lock me up or take my home if I refuse taxes?” or “If activists resist taxes, won’t the government use this as an excuse to crack down on dissent?”\n\nIs tax resistance *ethical?* (Values)\n: For instance: “Don’t we all need to pay our fair share?” or “Is it fair for me to decide where a democracy spends my taxes?”\n\nWhen answering questions like these, you should consider addressing both the specific question or concern and the whole category it represents.\nFor instance, you might answer a specific question about the ethics of tax resistance, and then add something about how your values led you to become a tax resister.\n\nYou can meet a question honestly in many ways.\nSometimes, a direct answer is best.\nOther times, it’s better to put the question into a larger context or to address the assumptions behind the question.\nIt can pay to practice meeting common questions in multiple ways.\n\nWith some questions the best policy is to change the subject.\nIf you’re about to begin an answer that looks likely to end with a defense of some particular political philosophy, what Jesus really meant, or the truth about what happened on 9/11—take a deep breath and start over.\n\nFor example, if someone asks, “do you think everybody should be able to decide on their own what their tax money can be spent on?” you could answer, “Yes: As a free-market anarchist, I think a society in which people make their own decisions about how to spend their money would be a big improvement,” but pretty soon you’re promoting anarchism and not tax resistance, and maybe you’re giving the impression that tax resistance is only for eccentric anarchists.\n\nThe question had a couple of purposes: The first was \u003Cem>to express a concern\u003C/em> about whether tax resistance is an ethical thing to do.\nThe second is more subtle, but involves the questioner \u003Cem>searching for an excuse\u003C/em> not to become a tax resister.\nThe questioner hopes to show that you hold some particular dogma (anarchism, pacifism, whatever), that adhering to this dogma is an essential part of being a tax resister, and that therefore the questioner doesn’t have to consider becoming a resister anymore since he or she doesn’t hold such views.\n\nBut you don’t have to cooperate.\nYou could answer something like this instead:\n“Maybe so and maybe not, but the war tax resisters I know spend their money more fairly and wisely than Congress does.\nIf war tax resisters were budgeting more money and Congress less,

This became an opportunity for more face-to-face contact among potential activists. Campaign historian Danny Burns recalls:\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The film was never shown, but the way the community was engaged in the process of making it is instructive. The film producers wanted a shot of all the doors in the street, opening one by one as the occupants came out of their houses with banners and signs. Charles, the local street rep, went round to people’s houses every evening for a week and explained to them what was wanted. Out of 30 houses in the street (a cul-de-sac) 28 agreed to participate. The street is multi-racial with a fairly wide class mix. It was inspiring to see white working class men standing shoulder to shoulder with Asian women and their kids, holding the same banners and engrossed in conversation. Some of them had never spoken to each other before. The film was made, but more importantly, as [a] result of making it, virtually every one of those households joined the Union, and most still had posters in their windows a year later. People were brought into the campaign, not through a leaflet or a canvasser, but through an interesting activity. They didn’t have to go to the campaign, it came to them.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Both the poll tax resistance campaign and the later Dublin water charge strikers used door-to-door surveys to good effect as well (see conduct surveys to gauge support).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-british-womens-suffrage-movement\">The British Women’s Suffrage Movement\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In 1913, British women’s suffrage activist Marie Lawson launched what she called a “snowball” protest:\na sort of chain letter in which she sent out letters that advocated tax resistance (and that protested on behalf of an imprisoned resister) and that asked the recipients to send the same letter “to at least three friends.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"us-military-aid-foes\">U.S. Military Aid Foes\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>When the United States approved a billion-dollar military aid package to the government of Colombia in 2000, the president of the Mennonite Church of Colombia, Peter Stucky, and Ricardo Esquivia, the director of that church’s Justapaz organization and the coordinator of the Evangelical Council of Colombia’s Human Rights and Peace Commission, wrote a letter to their sister churches in the United States.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In that letter, they explained the disastrous consequences of fueling the civil war and the military wing of the war on drugs in Colombia, and they told how the church there was trying to respond more productively to the crisis.\nThey called on American churches to do their part:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>In reality, the government of the United States, using the taxpayers’ money, is supporting the Colombian government in what we consider to be a negative form. This means that the message arriving from the North to the Colombian people becomes a message of death and destruction. For that reason we are calling the churches in the North to redeem their taxes, on one hand by demanding that the U.S. government invests this money in life-producing projects, and on the other hand by redirecting part of their taxes toward a different project in your community or the world that promotes abundant and dignified life, as our Lord Jesus Christ has commanded us.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>The American Mennonite Central Committee responded by urging taxpayers to redirect their taxes to the Mennonite-run “Taxes for Peace” fund, which would be dedicated that year to peace-building efforts in Colombia.\n(See also \u003Ca href=\"../../../tacticsofeducationandpublicrelations/redirecttaxestocharity/\">Redirect Resisted Taxes to Charity\u003C/a>.)\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"mennonites-in-world-war-i\">Mennonites in World War I\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This sort of advocacy can be dangerous.\nIn 1918, R.W. Benner, an American Mennonite minister, got worried reports from members of his congregation who were being told in no uncertain terms that they would buy so-called “Liberty Bonds” to support the U.S. war effort, or they would answer for their refusal.\nBenner wrote for advice to his bishop, L.J.

id=\"lessons-from-the-american-war-tax-resistance-movement\">Lessons from the American War Tax Resistance Movement\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>A well-crafted and timely personal message can make all the difference in motivating anti-war activists to become war tax resisters.\nI’ve spent some time investigating how the American war tax resistance movement can craft a more persuasive face-to-face recruitment message, and some of my conclusions would be valid for (or have analogies in) a variety of tax resistance campaigns.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As in sports, there’s an offensive game and a defensive game.\nOffense is knowing what message you want to convey, crafting it well, and deploying it effectively.\nDefense is anticipating questions, understanding the real concerns behind them, having good answers ready, and not getting thrown off-message.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To craft a motivating message, consider three categories of motivations: \u003Cem>needs\u003C/em>, \u003Cem>fears\u003C/em>, and \u003Cem>values\u003C/em>.\nTo motivate somebody to do something, show them how it will meet their needs (or not interfere with getting their needs met), protect them from something they fear (or not expose them to something frightening), and promote their values (or not require them to violate these values).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the government tries to motivate taxpayers, they rely on fears and values.\nFears of tax audits, criminal penalties, financial troubles, and so forth are important in shaping taxpayer compliance.\nBut it turns out that values are even more important.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 2012 the IRS Oversight Board surveyed American taxpayers to ask them what factors were important to them when they decided whether to report their income and pay their taxes.\n40% said that fear of an audit was a very important influence on this decision.\nBut 86% said “personal integrity” was very important (only 4% of those surveyed said integrity was not very or not at all important).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most American taxpayers pay taxes because they identify taxpaying with honesty, fairness, good citizenship, and their values as a whole.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>War tax resisters offer another path to integrity.\nThe more they speak about how their values motivate them to become tax resisters, the easier it is for people who share those values to imagine themselves as tax resisters.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But fear is also important.\nWhen NWTRCC surveyed 1,106 anti-war activists who had never done tax resistance before, the #1 reason they gave for why they hadn’t was “Fear legal consequences.”\nAsked what they thought were the two most likely consequences of war tax resistance, 31.6% included jail time (which in reality is extremely rare).\nAsked what they needed most before they would consider resisting, the #1 answer was “Clear idea of likely consequences.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>People imagine the consequences of war tax resistance to be much more frightening than they really are.\nThe war tax resistance movement should work hard to dispel this myth, not by saying “tax resistance is perfectly safe” but this:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>There are many methods of war tax resistance, with different levels and types of risk.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You can learn the risks in advance and take steps to mitigate them.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>If you take these steps the risks are much smaller than you might expect.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Hardly anyone goes to jail for war tax resistance.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>War tax resisters can also appeal to needs.\nAnti-war activists commonly say they’re tired of going to rallies and marches—they want to do something concrete that has a real, direct effect.\nTax resistance meets this need.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you’re playing defense, you’ll find that some questions come up frequently when tax resistance is discussed.\nThese also concern needs, fears, and values:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdl>\n\u003Cdt>Is tax resistance \u003Cem>effective?\u003C/em> (Needs)\u003C/dt>\n\u003Cdd>For instance: “Won’t the government just end up with more money after they add interest and penalties to the tax I resist?” or “How can one person’s refusal make a difference to the vast government budget?”\n\u003C/dd>\n\u003Cdt>Is tax resistance \u003Cem>safe?\u003C/em> (Fears)\u003C/dt>\n\u003Cdd>For instance: “Won’t they lock me up or take my home if I refuse taxes?” or “If activists resist taxes, won’t the government use this as an excuse to crack down on dissent?”\n\u003C/dd>\n\u003Cdt>Is tax resistance \u003Cem>ethical?\u003C/em> (Values)\u003C/dt>\n\u003Cdd>For instance: “Don’t we all need to pay our fair share?” or “Is it fair for me to decide where a democracy spends my taxes?”\n\u003C/dd>\n\u003C/dl>\n\u003Cp>When answering questions like these, you should consider addressing both the specific question or concern and the whole category it represents.\nFor instance, you might answer a specific question about the ethics of tax resistance, and then add something about how your values led you to become a tax resister.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You can meet a question honestly in many ways.\nSometimes, a direct answer is best.\nOther times, it’s better to put the question into a larger context or to address the assumptions behind the question.\nIt can pay to practice meeting common questions in multiple ways.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With some questions the best policy is to change the subject.\nIf you’re about to begin an answer that looks likely to end with a defense of some particular political philosophy, what Jesus really meant, or the truth about what happened on 9/11—take a deep breath and start over.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For example, if someone asks, “do you think everybody should be able to decide on their own what their tax money can be spent on?” you could answer, “Yes: As a free-market anarchist, I think a society in which people make their own decisions about how to spend their money would be a big improvement,” but pretty soon you’re promoting anarchism and not tax resistance, and maybe you’re giving the impression that tax resistance is only for eccentric anarchists.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The question had a couple of purposes: The first was \u003Cem>to express a concern\u003C/em> about whether tax resistance is an ethical thing to do.\nThe second is more subtle, but involves the questioner \u003Cem>searching for an excuse\u003C/em> not to become a tax resister.\nThe questioner hopes to show that you hold some particular dogma (anarchism, pacifism, whatever), that adhering to this dogma is an essential part of being a tax resister, and that therefore the questioner doesn’t have to consider becoming a resister anymore since he or she doesn’t hold such views.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But you don’t have to cooperate.\nYou could answer something like this instead:\n“Maybe so and maybe not, but the war tax resisters I know spend their money more fairly and wisely than Congress does.\nIf war tax resisters were budgeting more money and Congress less, we’d all breathe easier.\nBy taking responsibility for how my money is spent, I make sure Congress doesn’t spend it irresponsibly.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Comparisons are one good way to put things into context:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>“As protesters we are sometimes willing to be arrested doing sit-ins and blockades, and we risk jail time and fines for civil disobedience.

And the \u003Ci>Sardar\u003C/i> [Vallabhbhai Patel, who commanded the campaign] poured ridicule on Government for grudging the people the use of this their only weapon. “What do you do yourselves? Yours is a close corporation maintained by force of arms and its motive is no nobler than keeping a nation in bondage. We resort to this weapon simply for the sake of self-defence and self-preservation.” But he never omitted to emphasize its limitations, the very first being that in no circumstances should a Satyagrahi refuse to minister to the physical needs of the party boycotted. “Eschew by all means molestation or oppression. We may not refuse anyone milk, water, foodstuffs, help in case of illness or worse. We cannot afford to prosecute boycott at the expense of our humanity.”\n\nAmong the ways the Bardoli strikers boycotted those landowners who paid their property taxes was to refuse to rent their fields or to work as agricultural laborers for them.\n\n## American Revolution\n\nDuring the American revolution, boycotts of British imports were enforced by social boycott.\nOne resolution of boycotters read:\n\n> [W]e will not purchase any goods of any persons who, preferring their own interest to that of the public, shall import merchandise from Great Britain, until a general importation takes place; or of any trader who purchases his goods of such importer: and… we will hold no intercourse, or connection, or correspondence, with any person who shall purchase goods of such importer, or retailer; and we will hold him dishonored, an enemy to the liberties of his country, and infamous, who shall break this agreement.\n\nAnother said:\n\n> [W]hoever shall… in any wise aid or abet in unloading, receiving, or vending the tea sent or to be sent out by the East India Company while it remains subject to the payment of a duty here is an enemy to America— …That a Committee be immediately chosen to wait on those Gentlemen, who it is reported are appointed by the East India Company to receive and sell said tea, and to request them from a regard to their own characters and the peace and good order of this town and province immediately to resign their appointment.\n\n## The Anti-Pizzo Movement\n\nSicily’s branch of the Confindustria industrialists’ union unanimously voted in 2007 to expel any member who was caught paying protection money (the most primitive variety of tax) to the mafia, and a few dozen members were in fact expelled from the group under this policy.\n\n## Quakers\n\nMany Quaker meetings had a policy of “disowning” members who failed to practice war tax resistance or tithe resistance.\nSometimes, even failing to report that the government had subjected you to “sufferings” for your resistance could make you suspect.\nIf Quakers failed to report anything of this sort, others might be appointed to visit them and ask how they had managed to avoid government reprisals while maintaining their refusal to pay.\n\nDisowning was something like excommunication.\nIt withheld the benefits of meeting membership from the disobedient Quakers until such time as they repented and made satisfactory amends—which might include publicly admitting the wrong of their behavior at a future meeting.\nOccasionally, as during the American Revolution, disownings like these might lead to schisms and the emergence of rival meetings with different policies.\n\n## The Tithe War\n\nDuring the Tithe War in Ireland, according to one report:\n\n> [P]ersons accused of the crime of tithe-paying are summoned to appear and give an account of their conduct, and defaulters undergo the punishment of being abandoned at once by every person in their employment. Country gentlemen and farmers are left without a servant or labourer to perform the most necessary work. The hay is left to rot on the ground, and the cattle to perish for want of the necessary food, drink, and care; and even on the roads it is common for the horses of the mails and stage-coaches to be changed by the coachmen and passengers, because the unhappy recusant innkeeper has been deserted by every one, even to his hostler.\n\nAnother report complained:\n“The people of Ireland have now virtually abolished tithes.\nThey will neither pay the tax themselves, nor have any dealings or intercourse with those who do…\nThe man who in any way upholds the obnoxious system, whatever his previous character or services may have been, is branded as an object of universal execration.”\n\n## South African Miners\n\nWhen resisters at the “New Rush” in South Africa in 1874 pledged to refuse to pay further taxes, each one also pledged, “that I shall buy from, sell to, or deal with only such men as have also taken this pledge or obligation.”\n\n## Newly Enfranchised Pennsylvania Women\n\nWomen in Pennsylvania found themselves suddenly taxable in the wake of the success of the women’s suffrage movement.\nBut then they also became subject to strong social pressure to resist these new taxes.\nAccording to one report:\n\n> [One] woman, who is reported to have failed to pay her tax, asserted she was laughed at by her friends when she paid her tax in former years, and she would not be laughed at any longer.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Desai, Mahadev \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i> (1929) p. 170\n* Lincoln, William \u003Ci>History of Worcester, Massachusetts\u003C/i> (1862) p. 70\n* “Resolutions of the Town of Boston, November 5, 1773” in \u003Ci>The Writings of Samuel Adams\u003C/i>, (Echo Library: 2006) Volume III, p. 60\n* Kington, Tom “Shopkeepers revolt against Sicilian mafia” \u003Ci>The Observer\u003C/i> 8 March 2008\n* “Tithes in Ireland” \u003Ci>The [New Brunswick] Courier\u003C/i> 25 August 1832, p. 2 (in part quoting the \u003Ci>Liverpool Mercury\u003C/i> of 20 July 1832)\n* “Extract from the ‘Diamond Field’ Newspaper of November 25, 1874” \u003Ci>Correspondence Realting to the Colonies and States of South Africa: Further Correspondence respecting the Affairs of Griqualand West and the Diamond Fields\u003C/i> (1876) p. 22\n* “6 Women Defy Tax Collector” \u003Ci>The Nevada Daily Mail\u003C/i> 4 May 1927, p. 1\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/docs/tacticsthatincreasethenumberofresisters/socialboycottofnonresisters.md",[2408],"../../../assets/vallabhbhai-patel.gif","15267cb03e1c79f8",{"html":2411,"metadata":2412},"\u003Cp>A tax resistance campaign can sometimes increase participation or discourage attrition by enforcing a social boycott against non-resisters: shunning them and denying them the benefits of community and society.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"bardoli-tax-strike\">Bardoli Tax Strike\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Social boycott was an important tool of the Bardoli tax refusal campaign during the independence struggle in India.\nMahadev Desai, in \u003Ci>The Story of Bardoli\u003C/i>, writes:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/vallabhbhai-patel.gif&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigcaption>Vallabhbhai Patel\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>It is this weapon that exasperated the Government, but they were helpless because social boycott was no offence under the Penal Code.

which people can learn about the variety of war tax resistance methods and ask questions of people who have experience with them.\n\n## British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nEthel Ayres Purdie ran what she called the “Women Taxpayers’ Agency” and counseled British women’s suffrage activists on how best to resist their taxes on “no taxation without representation” grounds and how they could exploit legal quirks to legally avoid taxes.\n\nMembers of the Women’s Tax Resistance League regularly gave lectures on their tactics of choice at suffragist meetings, and recruited new resisters at these lectures.\n\n## The Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nPeople who resisted Thatcher’s poll tax gained confidence thanks to the efforts of the Poll Tax Legal Group which, among other things, “produced over 30 accessible legal bulletins on the Poll Tax and a book called \u003Ci>To Pay or Not To Pay\u003C/i>.”\n\nTo combat the threat of property seizure (sometimes the threat itself could be enough to

resistance.",[],{"order":54,"hidden":39,"attrs":2507},{},"One way a tax resistance campaign can claim victory is by convincing the government either to formally rescind an offensive tax or to recognize the legal validity of tax resistance.\n\n## John Hampden\n\nIn 1637, John Hampden refused to pay a new property tax that King Charles I had instituted without the consent of the English parliament.\nHis resistance succeeded at prompting the legal reform he sought.\n\nHe lost his legal battle, and was convicted by a slim majority of the judges who heard his case, but he successfully proved his point in the court of public opinion—“he grew the argument of all tongues, every man enquiring who, and what he was, that durst, at his own charge, support the liberty and property of the kingdom, and rescue his country, as he thought, from being made a prey to the court.”\n\nThe next parliament formally legalized his resistance by voiding the “ship money” tax and declaring that both the tax and the court judgement against Hampden “were and are contrary to and against the laws and statutes of this realm.”\n\n## American Amish\n\nThe resistance and conscientious objection of Amish people to a social insurance tax forced the U.S. government to change its tax laws.\n\nSome Amish felt that government-sponsored social insurance programs were both mistrustful of God and destructive to the mutual support that is so important to Amish community.\nWhen the Social Security program and its social insurance tax became mandatory, many refused to pay the tax and refused to apply for benefits.\n14,000 signed a petition to Congress asking for permission to opt out of the program.\n\nThe IRS began to try to enforce the law by seizing money directly from resisters’ bank accounts.\nAmish resisters responded by closing their accounts entirely.\nThe IRS then began to seize money from the cooperatives that purchased the resisters’ products, and then finally to seize the resisters’ property.\nThe regional IRS Chief of Collections said:\n“People have no right to use their religion as an excuse not to pay taxes.”\n\nAfter a number of sympathetic resisters had been subjected to property seizures by the IRS—in one case they seized a man’s horses as he was using them to plow his field—public outrage and Amish petitioning finally convinced Congress to grant the Amish an exemption from the Social Security system and to cancel the outstanding tax bills of 15,000 resisters.\n\n## “Peace Tax” Plans\n\nA number of pacifist groups, often including war tax resisters, have been trying to get their governments to recognize or legally formalize a right to conscientious objection to military spending.\nThey want conscientious objectors to be able to pay their taxes without paying for the military portion of the government’s budget: to pay a “Peace Tax.”\n\nSo far, none of these long-standing efforts—which have included persistent lobbying of legislators, as well as legal challenges using a variety of arguments and in a range of national and international fora—have borne much fruit.\nGovernments seem universally unwelcoming to the idea, and those international legal bodies with any clout have not yet been convinced that this alleged “right” deserves recognition.\n\nMany conscientious objectors are themselves skeptical of Peace Tax plans, and feel that they would no more be able to conscientiously pay into a government-administered Peace Tax Fund than into the rest of the government’s budget.\n\nOne challenge for Peace Tax promoters is that it is difficult to separate a government’s military budget from the rest of its budget in a way that would make a genuinely separate Peace Tax plausible.\nThe Peace Tax legislation currently being promoted in the U.S., for instance, would ironically result in \u003Cem>more\u003C/em> taxpayer money going to military projects, simply because it is easy for the government to shift money from place to place.\n\nGovernments cannot be trusted to implement schemes like these in a way that respects the intentions of those who would use them.\nHere is one particularly egregious example:\nItaly has a tax called the \u003Ci>otto per mille\u003C/i> (8‰).\nTaxpayers can ask the government either to turn their contributions to this tax over to the taxpayer’s church of choice as a tithe or to spend it on “humanitarian and cultural projects” of the government’s choosing.\nIn some respects, this resembles the sort of plan that Peace Tax promoters have in mind.\nBut Italy’s government cunningly declared its participation in the Iraq War to be a “humanitarian and cultural” project and siphoned the \u003Ci>otto per mille\u003C/i> funds off that way.\nMore recently they have been using the money for such “humanitarian and cultural” projects as prison construction.\n\nSome Peace Tax proposals try to solve this problem by taking the Peace Tax money out of the ordinary government budget and turning it over instead to some more-or-less independent body that has an explicit mandate to spend the money in ways that do not stain the consciences of its contributors.\nWhile plans like this are more attractive to conscientious objectors, they are much less so to the governments that would have to sign off on them.\n\nSome activists in Norway are trying to make it easy for the government to create a Peace Tax, by doing the hard work for it.\nThey created a charity they call the \u003Ci>Norges Fredsfond\u003C/i> (Norwegian Peace Fund) and are asking taxpayers to donate to the fund.\nWhen the fund reaches a critical mass of contributors it will gain legal tax-exempt status, and each dollar that people donate to it will reduce their taxes at their marginal tax rate (typically 28%, which means that—at least from one way of looking at it—a conscientious objector could offset his or her “war tax” by contributing about three times its amount to the fund).\n\nThe \u003Ci>Norges Fredsfond\u003C/i> is designed to resemble as much as possible a government-run peace tax fund that accepts tax money to be spent by the government on peace-promoting projects.\nThey hope that by laying the groundwork of creating and administering such a fund, they will be better able to convince the government to legalize conscientious objection to military taxation and to absorb the fund into the government as the lawful alternative fund for conscientious objectors to pay their taxes into.\n\n## Informal Legalization through Government Neglect\n\nA government may essentially concede simply by not trying to collect a tax or by not retaliating against resisters.\n\nColonial American Quaker war tax resister Joshua Evans was so persistent that eventually the tax collector surrendered.\n“I was told it was concluded that as I gave myself up very much to the service of Truth, it was not proper I should be troubled on account of military demands; and I understood my name was erased, or taken from their list.”\n\nOccasionally something similar happens today, when because a tax resister has so few assets, or those assets would take too much trouble to discover, the IRS marks the resister’s file as “uncollectible” and gives up the attempt to force payment.\nAfter ten years, a delinquent income tax payment falls under a statute of limitations and the U.S. government is generally forbidden to pursue the matter further.\n\nAmerican women’s suffrage activist Sarah E. Wall resisted her taxes for 25 years, when finally, according to Susan B. Anthony, “the assessor has left her name off the tax-list, and passed her by rather than have a lawsuit with her.”\nSomething similar happened to English suffragist tax resister Charlotte Despard and some others:\n“[T]he Government rather than go to the trouble of selling up the recalcitrant ‘debtor,’ and attracting attention to the principle involved, had quietly dropped the matter in several instances.\nMrs. Despard had had no application for taxes since she had been sold up last year.”\n\n## Conceding Without Conceding the Point\n\nWhen farmers in drought-ravaged regions of Argentina threatened a tax strike in 2009, the government responded with a clever bit of ju-jitsu:\nIt declared an agricultural emergency in the area.\nThis exempted those farmers from paying taxes.\nIn this way the government saved face by neither acknowledging defeat nor having to pursue the resisters.\n\n## Association of Real Estate Taxpayers\n\nProperty tax resisters in Depression-era Chicago won their concessions in court.\nA judge ruled that property assessments in the city had been performed incorrectly—$15 billion in property held by wealthy, well-connected Chicagoans had been somehow left off the rolls.\nWhen they won their case, their tax resistance was effectively legalized and the government was forced to cease its attempts to collect back taxes from the resisters.\n\n## Irish Land League\n\nThe Irish National Land League proved that the pressure of a rent strike can work on landlords in the same way a tax strike can work on governments.\nDuring the rent strike, Charles Stewart Parnell reported that “a large majority of landlords” reduced the rents on their properties.\n\n> The action of such a large majority of landlords, in reducing their rents, \u003Cem>after\u003C/em> the League had been formed, and the system of passive resistance fairly established, shows that they did finally recognize the situation, and that they determined to make the best of it.\n\n## Prussia and Russia\n\nSometimes tax resistance becomes “legalized” through a conflict between rival governments or branches of government.\nFor instance, when the Prussian quasi-autocracy tried to ignore the legislature and govern on its own in 1848, the National Assembly formally declared tax resistance to be legal, and said that the autocrats had no authority to raise or spend money.\n\nSomething similar happened in Russia half a century later, when the Czar dissolved the Duma, which then reconvened in Vyborg, Finland and called on the citizens to refuse to pay any more taxes to the Czar.\n\n## Governments Cannot Be Trusted\n\nBeware of trusting the government when it responds to your tax resistance campaign by insisting that it’s on your side and wants to help, or that you’ve made your point and they promise to change.\nThis is a very common gambit and often just means they hope you’ll give up and go away or get distracted by something else before they have to make good on their promise.\n\nWhen tax resistance leader Wat Tyler was assassinated while he was negotiating with the king in 1379, the king boldly went out to the enraged crowd and stunned them by telling them that from now on \u003Cem>he\u003C/em> would be their leader and would personally see to it that their demands were enacted.\nInstead, he waited for the fuss to die down, then executed some of the other leaders of the rebellion:\n“The low people were reduced to the same slavish condition as before, and several of the ringleaders were punished with capital severity.”\n\nWhen the Whigs were whisked into power in the wake of the Reform Act agitation around 1832, the tax resistance movement celebrated its victory… only to find that the Whigs could be just as tyrannical about prosecuting those who promoted tax resistance as their Tory cousins.\nIn 1834, a prosecution was brought against the proprietor of \u003Ci>The True Sun\u003C/i> for publishing “malicious and seditious libels, in which the people of this country were called upon to resist the payment of the assessed taxes.”\n\nDuring the Annuity Tax strike in Edinburgh, the government tried to mollify the resisters by passing something it called the “Edinburgh Annuity Tax Abolition Act.”\nAbolishing the annuity tax was exactly what the tax resisters wanted, but, despite its name, that act did not abolish the annuity tax at all, but merely concealed it by wrapping it in with another tax under another name.\nThe resisters were not fooled, and the resistance continued.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes

sometimes good intentions lead to counterproductive laws and policies, and this is one example.\n  If you read their literature, you’ll see that they admit that the bill would increase government revenue without decreasing how much Congress could spend on war:\n\n  First, they admit that if the bill were to pass “The government would receive more revenue from increased participation in the payment of income taxes and would spend less on the cost of forced collections.”\n  They also say, of those who pay into the PTF, “nor will their participation in the Peace Tax Fund directly decrease the amount of money spent on war [as] this would violate the Constitutionally given powers of Congress to determine spending priorities.”\n\n  So Congress would have more taxpayer money than before and could spend as much as it wants on war.\n  Sources: “Your Tax Dollars at Work” NCPTF fact sheet, 25 October 2012; “Questions and Answers about the Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund Bill” NCPTF

bankrupt, out-of-business, vanished into thin air, or something of that sort.\n  Another 23% consists of interest and penalties that the government considers to have inherently “less potential for future collection” although they still hold out hopes of recovering it.\n  The remaining 37% is divided into a “collectible” portion (8.5%) and an “uncollectible” portion (28.5%).\n  [“Financial

resistance succeeded at prompting the legal reform he sought.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He lost his legal battle, and was convicted by a slim majority of the judges who heard his case, but he successfully proved his point in the court of public opinion—“he grew the argument of all tongues, every man enquiring who, and what he was, that durst, at his own charge, support the liberty and property of the kingdom, and rescue his country, as he thought, from being made a prey to the court.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The next parliament formally legalized his resistance by voiding the “ship money” tax and declaring that both the tax and the court judgement against Hampden “were and are contrary to and against the laws and statutes of this realm.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"american-amish\">American Amish\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The resistance and conscientious objection of Amish people to a social insurance tax forced the U.S. government to change its tax laws.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some Amish felt that government-sponsored social insurance programs were both mistrustful of God and destructive to the mutual support that is so important to Amish community.\nWhen the Social Security program and its social insurance tax became mandatory, many refused to pay the tax and refused to apply for benefits.\n14,000 signed a petition to Congress asking for permission to opt out of the program.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The IRS began to try to enforce the law by seizing money directly from resisters’ bank accounts.\nAmish resisters responded by closing their accounts entirely.\nThe IRS then began to seize money from the cooperatives that purchased the resisters’ products, and then finally to seize the resisters’ property.\nThe regional IRS Chief of Collections said:\n“People have no right to use their religion as an excuse not to pay taxes.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After a number of sympathetic resisters had been subjected to property seizures by the IRS—in one case they seized a man’s horses as he was using them to plow his field—public outrage and Amish petitioning finally convinced Congress to grant the Amish an exemption from the Social Security system and to cancel the outstanding tax bills of 15,000 resisters.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"peace-tax-plans\">“Peace Tax” Plans\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>A number of pacifist groups, often including war tax resisters, have been trying to get their governments to recognize or legally formalize a right to conscientious objection to military spending.\nThey want conscientious objectors to be able to pay their taxes without paying for the military portion of the government’s budget: to pay a “Peace Tax.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So far, none of these long-standing efforts—which have included persistent lobbying of legislators, as well as legal challenges using a variety of arguments and in a range of national and international fora—have borne much fruit.\nGovernments seem universally unwelcoming to the idea, and those international legal bodies with any clout have not yet been convinced that this alleged “right” deserves recognition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Many conscientious objectors are themselves skeptical of Peace Tax plans, and feel that they would no more be able to conscientiously pay into a government-administered Peace Tax Fund than into the rest of the government’s budget.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One challenge for Peace Tax promoters is that it is difficult to separate a government’s military budget from the rest of its budget in a way that would make a genuinely separate Peace Tax plausible.\nThe Peace Tax legislation currently being promoted in the U.S., for instance, would ironically result in \u003Cem>more\u003C/em> taxpayer money going to military projects, simply because it is easy for the government to shift money from place to place.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Governments cannot be trusted to implement schemes like these in a way that respects the intentions of those who would use them.\nHere is one particularly egregious example:\nItaly has a tax called the \u003Ci>otto per mille\u003C/i> (8‰).\nTaxpayers can ask the government either to turn their contributions to this tax over to the taxpayer’s church of choice as a tithe or to spend it on “humanitarian and cultural projects” of the government’s choosing.\nIn some respects, this resembles the sort of plan that Peace Tax promoters have in mind.\nBut Italy’s government cunningly declared its participation in the Iraq War to be a “humanitarian and cultural” project and siphoned the \u003Ci>otto per mille\u003C/i> funds off that way.\nMore recently they have been using the money for such “humanitarian and cultural” projects as prison construction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some Peace Tax proposals try to solve this problem by taking the Peace Tax money out of the ordinary government budget and turning it over instead to some more-or-less independent body that has an explicit mandate to spend the money in ways that do not stain the consciences of its contributors.\nWhile plans like this are more attractive to conscientious objectors, they are much less so to the governments that would have to sign off on them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some activists in Norway are trying to make it easy for the government to create a Peace Tax, by doing the hard work for it.\nThey created a charity they call the \u003Ci>Norges Fredsfond\u003C/i> (Norwegian Peace Fund) and are asking taxpayers to donate to the fund.\nWhen the fund reaches a critical mass of contributors it will gain legal tax-exempt status, and each dollar that people donate to it will reduce their taxes at their marginal tax rate (typically 28%, which means that—at least from one way of looking at it—a conscientious objector could offset his or her “war tax” by contributing about three times its amount to the fund).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Ci>Norges Fredsfond\u003C/i> is designed to resemble as much as possible a government-run peace tax fund that accepts tax money to be spent by the government on peace-promoting projects.\nThey hope that by laying the groundwork of creating and administering such a fund, they will be better able to convince the government to legalize conscientious objection to military taxation and to absorb the fund into the government as the lawful alternative fund for conscientious objectors to pay their taxes into.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"informal-legalization-through-government-neglect\">Informal Legalization through Government Neglect\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>A government may essentially concede simply by not trying to collect a tax or by not retaliating against resisters.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Colonial American Quaker war tax resister Joshua Evans was so persistent that eventually the tax collector surrendered.\n“I was told it was concluded that as I gave myself up very much to the service of Truth, it was not proper I should be troubled on account of military demands; and I understood my name was erased, or taken from their list.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Occasionally something similar happens today, when because a tax resister has so few assets, or those assets would take too much trouble to discover, the IRS marks the resister’s file as “uncollectible” and gives up the attempt to force payment.\nAfter ten years, a delinquent income tax payment falls under a statute of limitations and the U.S. government is generally forbidden to pursue the matter further.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>American women’s suffrage activist Sarah E. Wall resisted her taxes for 25 years, when finally, according to Susan B. Anthony, “the assessor has left her name off the tax-list, and passed her by rather than have a lawsuit with her.”\nSomething similar happened to English suffragist tax resister Charlotte Despard and some others:\n“[T]he Government rather than go to the trouble of selling up the recalcitrant ‘debtor,’ and attracting attention to the principle involved, had quietly dropped the matter in several instances.\nMrs. Despard had had no application for taxes since she had been sold up last year.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"conceding-without-conceding-the-point\">Conceding Without Conceding the Point\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>When farmers in drought-ravaged regions of Argentina threatened a tax strike in 2009, the government responded with a clever bit of ju-jitsu:\nIt declared an agricultural emergency in the area.\nThis exempted those farmers from paying taxes.\nIn this way the government saved face by neither acknowledging defeat nor having to pursue the resisters.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2

property assessments in the city had been performed incorrectly—$15 billion in property held by wealthy, well-connected Chicagoans had been somehow left off the rolls.\nWhen they won their case, their tax resistance was effectively legalized and the government was forced to cease its attempts to collect back taxes from the resisters.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"irish-land-league\">Irish Land League\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The Irish National Land League proved that the pressure of a rent strike can work on landlords in the same way a tax strike can work on governments.\nDuring the rent strike, Charles Stewart Parnell reported that “a large majority of landlords” reduced the rents on their properties.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The action of such a large majority of landlords, in reducing their rents, \u003Cem>after\u003C/em> the League had been formed, and the system of passive resistance fairly established, shows that they did finally recognize the situation, and that they determined to make the best of it.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"prussia-and-russia\">Prussia and Russia\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Sometimes tax resistance becomes “legalized” through a conflict between rival governments or branches of government.\nFor instance, when the Prussian quasi-autocracy tried to ignore the legislature and govern on its own in 1848, the National Assembly formally declared tax resistance to be legal, and said that the autocrats had no authority to raise or spend money.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Something similar happened in Russia half a century later, when the Czar dissolved the Duma, which then reconvened in Vyborg, Finland and called on the citizens to refuse to pay any more taxes to the Czar.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"governments-cannot-be-trusted\">Governments Cannot Be Trusted\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Beware of trusting the government when it responds to your tax resistance campaign by insisting that it’s on your side and wants to help, or that you’ve made your point and they promise to change.\nThis is a very common gambit and often just means they hope you’ll give up and go away or get distracted by something else before they have to make good on their promise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When tax resistance leader Wat Tyler was assassinated while he was negotiating with the king in 1379, the king boldly went out to the enraged crowd and stunned them by telling them that from now on \u003Cem>he\u003C/em> would be their leader and would personally see to it that their demands were enacted.\nInstead, he waited for the fuss to die down, then executed some of the other leaders of the rebellion:\n“The low people were reduced to the same slavish condition as before, and several of the ringleaders were punished with capital severity.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the Whigs were whisked into power in the wake of the Reform Act agitation around 1832, the tax resistance movement celebrated its victory… only to find that the Whigs could be just as tyrannical about prosecuting those who promoted tax resistance as their Tory cousins.\nIn 1834, a prosecution was brought against the proprietor of \u003Ci>The

Scott studies leaderless, grassroots resistance—and he has noted some examples of tax resistance that follow this pattern.\nSuch “everyday resistance,” as he calls it, has many advantages:\nit is hard for the government to combat, it can snowball under its own momentum, and it promises an easy payoff to individual resisters without requiring much risk or responsibility.\n“[T]he peasantry’s most common and durable weapon,” Scott says, “is an everyday resistance that stops short of the more dangerous forms of overt protest and confrontation.”\n\n> Everyday resistance does not throw up the manifestos, demonstrations, or pitched battles that normally compel attention. It makes no headlines. But just as millions of anthozoan polyps create, willy-nilly, a coral reef, so do thousands of individual acts of insubordination and evasion create a political and economic barrier reef of their own. There is rarely any dramatic confrontation, any movement that is particularly newsworthy. And whenever, to pursue the simile, the ship of state runs aground on such a reef, attention is typically directed to the shipwreck (for example, a fiscal crisis) itself and not to the vast aggregation of petty acts that made it possible.\n\nFor example, when the government of Malaysia nationalized the traditional Islamic tithe in 1960, made it mandatory, set its rate, and started assessing the property of farmers to determine how much they must pay, the farmers developed a variety of strategies to reduce the tithe to levels they felt were more appropriate.\nScott summarizes the resistance this way:\n\n> There have been no tithe riots, no tithe demonstrations, no petitions, no violent confrontations, no protests of any kind. Why protest, indeed, when quieter stratagems have achieved the same results at minimal risk? …it is the safer course for resisters to leave the tithe system standing in name while they dismantle it in practice… without affording the state an easily discernible target. There is no organization to be banned, no conspiratorial leaders to round up or buy off, no rioters to haul before the courts—only the generalized non-compliance by thousands of peasants.\n\nBecause members of the exploited class typically lack meaningful access to the legislative and administrative levers of power, they wisely take their political stand instead at the point of enforcement.\nAs Thoreau put it:\n\n> I meet this American government, or its representative the State government, directly, and face to face, once a year, no more, in the person of its tax-gatherer; this is the only mode in which a man situated as I am necessarily meets it; and it then says distinctly, Recognize me; and the simplest, the most effectual, and, in the present posture of affairs, the indispensablest mode of treating with it on this head, of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for it, is to deny it then.\n\nSome taxes are just so widely ignored and difficult to enforce that though they remain on the books, they exist only in a state of hibernation.\nFor example, those American states that have a sales tax cannot enforce that sales tax on merchants from other states—so when their subjects purchase products from out-of-state vendors, the states try to recover their cut by means of a “use tax” that is due from the purchaser.\nThis means that anyone who orders something from a catalog or from an out-of-state vendor on the internet is supposed to keep careful track of how much they’ve spent on such things throughout the year and then write a check to their state government for the use tax.\nIn practice, almost nobody does this, and the tax might as well not be on the books at all, at least as it applies to the ordinary consumer.\n\n## Pennsylvania Women\n\nHere is one example of a grassroots, leaderless, tax strike:\nShortly after women in Pennsylvania won the vote they discovered that they’d become taxed as a booby prize.\nMany found the bargain unsatisfactory and refused to pay.\nThey were also upset that the tax exempted people in urban areas (Philadelphia and Pittsburgh), which put the burden of the tax on rural families.\nResistance sprung up all across the state, without any hints of formal organization that I have been able to uncover, and persisted for several years.\nIt had the authorities thoroughly stymied.\nSome news accounts from the period gave counts of resisters in different regions, including:\n\n* 89 women in Pottstown\n* 300 women in Darby\n* 1,700 women in Charleroi\n* 800 women in Haverford\n* 250 women in Media\n* 700 women in Clifton Heights\n* 200 women in Freeland\n\nOn occasion, a contracting tax collector would go back to the government and request that the resisting women be stricken from the tax rolls so that the collector would not be responsible for their taxes.\nSometimes such requests were granted—as in the case of Clifton Heights, where those women who \u003Cem>had\u003C/em> paid up then indignantly demanded refunds.\n\nWith resisters numbering in the thousands, and resistance taking place over several years, this was one of the major tax rebellions in American history.\nYet because it had no leaders or formal organization, issued no manifestos or petitions, and never held big, photogenic rallies or marches, it is nearly unsung in the historical record.\n\n## What It Takes\n\nScott says that there are three factors that contribute to the adoption of “everyday resistance”:\n\n1. “a palpable ‘climate of opinion’”—a widespread belief that the tax is unjust and that resistance is proper\n1. “a shared knowledge of the available techniques of evasion”\n1. “economic interest”—the fact that it is personally economically advantageous to resist paying the tax\n\nTogether these “can produce a form of tacit coordination that mimics or substitutes for formal organization.”\n\nScott says that once tax resistance becomes normal, it becomes lawful by a sort of shared consensus, whatever the actual statutes say.\nA government that decides to begin trying to enforce the law in defiance of this consensus must exercise extraordinary effort to do so, and will probably be seen as exceeding its authority.\n\nHe suggests that “the social historian could profitably examine the role of petty tax resistance in producing, over time, the ‘fiscal crisis of the state’ which frequently presages radical political change.\nHere too, without intending it, the small self-serving acts of thousands of petty producers may deprive a regime of the wherewithal to maintain its ruling coalition and prevail against its enemies.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Scott, James C. “Resistance without Protest and without Organization: Peasant Opposition to the Islamic Zakat and the Christian Tithe” \u003Ci>Comparative Studies in Society and History\u003C/i> July 1987, pp. 417–52\n* Scott, James C. \u003Ci>Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance\u003C/i> (1985) p. 36\n* Thoreau, H.D.

Cooperative Housing","Some tax resisters have formed cooperative housing arrangements that help them to resist.",[],{"order":75,"hidden":39,"attrs":2691},{},"Some tax resisters have formed cooperative housing arrangements that help them to resist.\nI have mostly seen this tactic among war tax resisters, many of whom resist as an ongoing commitment rather than a protest or rebellion against a particular government or policy.\n\nGovernments usually inflict taxes when money changes hands:\nIncome taxes when people earn or receive money, payroll taxes when employers pay employees, sales taxes when consumers purchase goods, value-added taxes as goods move through the supply chain, estate taxes when assets are inherited, tariffs and customs duties when transactions take place that cross borders, and so on.\nIndividuals pay some of these taxes directly, and others indirectly through higher prices of goods and services.\n\nSome tax resisters have decided that they can resist such taxes more comprehensively by taking more of their activities out of the marketplace entirely—by relying less on economic transactions and more on community.\nCooperative housing arrangements are one way they can help each other to do this.\n\nFor instance the Bijou Community in Colorado Springs, Colorado, “runs services for the mentally-ill, homeless, working poor, incarcerated, and the general community, including: a soup kitchen, food banks, a land trust, several homes for transitional and homeless folks, a free bicycle clinic, and a musical theater group” but it also serves as a mutual support for its members, who each earn incomes that are below the taxable level as a method of war tax resistance.\n\nThe Agape Community in Massachusetts describes itself as “a lay Catholic residential community, ecumenical and interfaith in outreach and practice, with a focus on daily prayer, evangelical simplicity (eco-spirituality, sustainability, organic garden, vegetable oil fueled car, straw bale house, compost toilet, solar energy, wood stoves for cooking and heat), and nonviolent witness in the world, including actions against war, peace vigils, tax resistance, and civil disobedience when called, as we attempt to build a nonviolent world.”\nIt was founded by war tax resisters and supports volunteers who are living on a below-the-tax-line income.\n\nWar tax resisters organized the Valley Community Land Trust in Massachusetts to hold the property and its buildings as a non-profit corporation.\nThis structure helps the resisters to have homes of their own without their tax resistance making the homes vulnerable to seizure.\nWhen the IRS tried to seize the home of Randy Kehler and Betsy Corner in 1989, the members of the community rallied around them and helped get their home returned to them.\n\nThe Possibility Alliance farm in Missouri is a simple-living showcase guided by five principles: radical simplicity, service, social activism, inner work, and gratitude.\nIt hosts free skills-share classes and a group called the “Superheroes” who dress up like caped crusaders and bike out to do good deeds here and there.\nThe founders are war tax resisters who resist by maintaining a very low (sub-poverty line) income.\n\nNot only war tax resisters have used this technique.\nThe Irish National Land League organized a mass rent strike in the late-nineteenth century, aimed at English landlords and the political structure that prioritized their rights over those of Irish tenants.\nWhen landlords evicted tenants who refused to pay rent, the League would try to find the tenants (and sometimes their livestock) a temporary home on the land of someone who was sympathetic with the resisters.\nThese encampments might grow to hold several families and were sometimes called “Land League Villages.”\nOn one occasion, hundreds of evicted rent strikers founded a new town, “New Tipperary,” on the outskirts of Tipperary, which was largely owned by one rich landlord and parliamentarian.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Weismann, Eric

housing arrangements that help them to resist.\nI have mostly seen this tactic among war tax resisters, many of whom resist as an ongoing commitment rather than a protest or rebellion against a particular government or policy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Governments usually inflict taxes when money changes hands:\nIncome taxes when people earn or receive money, payroll taxes when employers pay employees, sales taxes when consumers purchase goods, value-added taxes as goods move through the supply chain, estate taxes when assets are inherited, tariffs and customs duties when transactions take place that cross borders, and so on.\nIndividuals pay some of these taxes directly, and others indirectly through higher prices of goods and services.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some tax resisters have decided that they can resist such taxes more comprehensively by taking more of their activities out of the marketplace entirely—by relying less on economic transactions and more on community.\nCooperative housing arrangements are one way they can help each other to do this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For instance the Bijou Community in Colorado Springs, Colorado, “runs services for the mentally-ill, homeless, working poor, incarcerated, and the general community, including: a soup kitchen, food banks, a land trust, several homes for transitional and homeless folks, a free bicycle clinic, and a musical theater group” but it also serves as a mutual support for its members, who each earn incomes that are below the taxable level as a method of war tax resistance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Agape Community in Massachusetts describes itself as “a lay Catholic residential community, ecumenical and interfaith in outreach and practice, with a focus on daily prayer, evangelical simplicity (eco-spirituality, sustainability, organic garden, vegetable oil fueled car, straw bale house, compost toilet, solar energy, wood stoves for cooking and heat), and nonviolent witness in the world, including actions against war, peace vigils, tax resistance, and civil disobedience when called, as we attempt to build a nonviolent world.”\nIt was founded by war tax resisters and supports volunteers who are living on a below-the-tax-line income.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>War tax resisters organized the Valley Community Land Trust in Massachusetts to hold the property and its buildings as a non-profit corporation.\nThis structure helps the resisters to have homes of their own without their tax resistance making the homes vulnerable to seizure.\nWhen the IRS tried to seize the home of Randy Kehler and Betsy Corner in 1989, the members of the community rallied around them and helped get their home returned to them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Possibility Alliance farm in Missouri is a simple-living showcase guided by five principles: radical simplicity, service, social activism, inner work, and gratitude.\nIt hosts free skills-share classes and a group called the “Superheroes” who dress up like caped crusaders and bike out to do good deeds here and there.\nThe founders are war tax resisters who resist by maintaining a very low (sub-poverty line) income.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not only war tax resisters have used this technique.\nThe Irish National Land League organized a mass rent strike in the late-nineteenth century, aimed at English landlords and the political structure that prioritized their rights over those of Irish tenants.\nWhen landlords evicted tenants who refused to pay rent, the League would try to find the tenants (and sometimes their livestock) a temporary home on the land of someone who was sympathetic with the resisters.\nThese encampments might grow to hold several families and were sometimes called “Land League Villages.”\nOn one occasion, hundreds of evicted rent strikers founded a new town, “New Tipperary,” on the outskirts of Tipperary, which was largely owned by one rich landlord and parliamentarian.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Weismann, Eric \u003Ca

involve courtroom battles, it will be useful to develop legal expertise or to have experts you can call on.\n\n## Dublin Water Charge Strike\n\nDuring the Dublin water charge strike in 1994–96, the courts became another mechanism resisters could use to disrupt the government in the hopes of forcing it to concede:\n\n> Every possible legal angle was pursued by the campaign’s legal team—down to legal definitions of what constituted a householder, making the councils prove that the person they had summonsed actually lived at the address, that they owned the property, etc., etc. We weren’t doing this because we had any illusions in the impartiality of the court system. We knew that even though we were successful in finding various legal loopholes, these would all be closed one by one and that the judges would be doing their best to facilitate the councils…\n>\n> But by contesting every detail of every summons we could make the system unworkable. There were tens of thousands of non-payers. After several months the councils had only managed to get a couple of dozen cases through the courts. Someone calculated that at the rate they were managing to proceed it would take them something like 220 years to process all the cases. And it was costing them more in legal fees than they could ever hope to take back in charges—even if they managed to bully everyone into paying.\n>\n> Any time the council did manage to get a court order, it was appealed—again the objective being to clog up the system.\n\n## Poll Tax Rebellion\n\nThe water charge resisters had learned well from the successes of the poll tax resistance movement in Britain a few years before.\nDanny Burns, in his chronicle of that struggle, described the careful and methodical way the anti-poll tax campaign defended resisters in court.\n\nThey kept track of and reached out to people facing legal sanctions for their resistance:\n\n> In Bristol when the court cases started, each person with a summons who rang into the office was logged and sent an information pack. The same personal attention was given to people with notices from the bailiffs. At the peak of the campaign, the Bristol office was staffed morning and afternoon five days a week by different volunteers. Between February and May 1990, it was receiving over 200 calls a week.… [Volunteers included] at least five court support workers…\n\nThey trained volunteers in strategies that they could use to make the legal proceedings work for the benefit of the resisters:\n\n> In every part of England and Wales local groups mobilised to provide support for non-payers in the courts. Tens if not hundreds of activists in each region attended legal briefing sessions. These were run both by activists and sympathetic local lawyers. People were given ideas about how they might disrupt or delay the court proceedings. These included simple things, like asking for a glass of water because their throat was dry, demanding to see the identity cards of everyone present in court, to fainting in court or arranging for fire alarms to go off. People were told to demand their rights to see and read every document which was produced as evidence against them. They were also given briefings on the basic technical arguments.\n>\n> By October 1990, when most of the court cases had started, virtually every Anti-Poll Tax Union in the UK had trained at least two or three of its members to become conversant with the Poll Tax law. Throughout England and Wales over a thousand people were trained to do court support work and could quote the relevant legislation….\n\nWith expert oversight, they published a legal guide for resisters:\n\n> [T]he Poll Tax Legal Group… researched legislation and case law. It set up a network of lawyers throughout England and Wales who could support the legal challenges of Anti-Poll Tax groups and produced over 30 accessible legal bulletins on the Poll Tax and a book called \u003Ci>To Pay or Not To Pay\u003C/i>. These underpinned the legal needs of the movement and helped ordinary people to get to grips with the law they needed to use.\n\nAnd they successfully fought back by exploiting legal technicalities:\n\n> Councils were challenged for sending notices to the wrong addresses. Given the rate at which people moved houses, it was difficult for the councils to keep up, and as a result many cases were dropped because people hadn’t received proper notice. Big legal challenges were also made over “correct procedures.” These came in the first few weeks and resulted mostly from the inexperience of councils in dealing with this sort of process. The first day of Medina Council’s cases (on the Isle of Wight) is probably the most famous example. The reminder notices were sent out with second class stamps, they consequently arrived late, people didn’t receive the statutory notice which they were entitled to, and the court threw out all 1,900 cases. The council had to start again.\n\nWhen police attacked an anti-poll tax demonstration in London, many of the demonstrators fought back, and hundreds were arrested.\nSome elements of the campaign leadership distanced themselves from the defendants, worried about the public relations problems of associating the movement with violence.\nSo other activists helped to form and coordinate an independent group—the Trafalgar Square Defendants’ Campaign (TSDC)—with the following mandate:\n\n> The campaign will:\n> * Unconditionally defend all of those arrested on March 31st.\n> * Be controlled by and be accountable to the defendants\n> * Be totally independent of any other organisation.\n> * Seek support from the whole Anti-Poll Tax movement and all other sympathetic organisations.\n> * Seek to co-ordinate the legal defence of all those arrested.\n> * Seek to build a coherent picture of events of 31/3/90 from the point of view of those arrested.\n> * Publicise the points of view of defendants.\n> * Raise money for a bust fund, controlled by the defendants to cover their legal and welfare costs.\n> * Ensure that at all future Anti-Poll Tax events there will be proper legal cover and support for anyone arrested. This will include an office and workers to visit places of detention and look after prisoners’ welfare.\n\nBurns writes, of the TSDC:\n\n> About a dozen people volunteered to carry out the court monitoring process. They attended every hearing, systematically took notes of everything that was said, recorded the numbers of police officers and approached the defendants asking them to attend the now weekly TSDC meetings… By the summer, over 250 of the defendants had been contacted.\n>\n> The TSDC ran advice sessions on prison, produced legal briefing notes and mailed out the minutes of the weekly meetings to every defendant every week. A solicitors’ group was established with a core of three, but at the peak of early activity they managed to get over fifteen solicitors involved. This proved important because the solicitors’ group managed to get hold of over 50 hours of police videos and handed them over to the campaign. The police videos were crucial in getting a lot of people off, and a number of people in the campaign worked extremely hard editing videos and rejigging them for particular trials. The solicitors’ group also got the Crown Prosecution Service to hand over a full list of all of the defendants and the names and addresses of their lawyers. The lawyers were all contacted and, although many were initially reluctant to cooperate with the campaign, they soon realised that TSDC had a lot of information which their clients needed.\n\n## British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nLegal expertise can also help your campaign find flaws in the tax law that you can use to expose it to ridicule.\nFor instance, in 1912 Mark Wilks was arrested and sent to Brixton Prison for failing to pay \u003Cem>his wife’s \u003C/em>income taxes.\nThe case became a \u003Ci>cause célèbre\u003C/i> in the British women’s suffrage movement and an embarrassment to the British government and its tax authorities.\n\nEthel Ayres Purdie, a tax law expert with the Women’s Tax Resistance League, discovered the vulnerability.\nThe Income Tax Act, she wrote, “is a most fearsome piece of composition.\nIts language is archaic and tautological, it rises wholly superior to punctuation, and proceeds breathlessly through one hundred and ninety-four clauses.”\nOne of those clauses held a flaw.\n\n![](../../../assets/women-taxpayers-agency.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>an ad for Ethel Ayres Purdie’s “Women Taxpayers’ Agency”\u003C/figcaption>\n\nThe Married Woman’s Property Act of 1882 was a reform that allowed married women to maintain control of their property rather than relinquishing it to their husbands’ control upon marriage.\nBut the earlier (1842) Income Tax Act still considered the husband to be solely liable for the income taxes of both the husband and wife.\n\nAt first, when Elizabeth Wilks began resisting her income tax, the government responded by seizing and selling her property, but when this quirk in the law was discovered, tax resisters like Wilks protested that the government could not legally seize \u003Cem>her\u003C/em> property since as a married woman her taxes were legally owed by the \u003Cem>him\u003C/em> in the marriage.\nSo the government went after Mark Wilks instead and arrested him when he did not pay his wife’s taxes.\n\nMark Wilks insisted that he could hardly fill out an income tax return since he had no legal right to demand information from his wife about her income!\nBesides, his own modest income and lack of property in his own name meant that he could not afford to pay the taxes on his wife’s considerably larger income (he did pay the tax on the portion of their joint income that was attributable to his own income, though his income was low enough that by itself it would not have been taxable).\n“I am informed that I am liable for taxes levied on her income,” he complained, “while at the same time the law places all her property entirely beyond my control.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Women’s Tax Resistance League trumpeted the arrest of Mark Wilks and his indefinite imprisonment—“for non-payment of taxes not his own and due on an income over which he has no control and whose amount he can only guess at”—as proving their contention that not only should women resist the income tax, but that married women were not even legally obligated to pay it and those women who were paying it were operating under a legal delusion.\n\nThe imprisonment of Mark Wilks was a great public relations opportunity:\n\n> For what do the arrest and imprisonment of Mark Wilks mean? We are perfectly certain that it will not last long. Stupid and inept as it has been, the Government, we are certain, will not risk the odium which would justly fall upon it if this outrage on liberty went on. A Government which has much at stake and which lives by the breath of popular opinion cannot afford to ignore such strong and healthy protest as is being poured out on all sides. To us, who are in the midst of it, that which seems most remarkable is the growth of public feeling. In the streets where processions are nightly held, we were met at first by banter and rowdyism. “A man in prison for the sake of Suffragettes!” To the boy-mind of the metropolis, on the outskirts of many an earnest crowd, that seemed irresistibly funny; but thoughtfulness is spreading; into even the boy-mind, the light of truth is creeping. If it had done nothing else, the imprisonment of Mark Wilks has certainly done this—it has educated the public mind.\n\nWilks was released after less than a month in prison, without receiving any official explanation, and without paying the tax.\n\n## American War Tax Resisters\n\nNot all legal help is welcome.\nSome resisters prefer to submit passively and unconcernedly to the legal machinations the government puts so much stock in.\nSome such resisters have better things to do with their time and energy than to worry about the minutiae of laws and legal procedures.\nOthers may not want to humor the conceit that a process of justice is taking place around them.\n\nFor example, when American war tax resister Maurice McCrackin was convicted of refusing to cooperate with an IRS summons, he was following a strategy of complete noncooperation that he kept following right into the courtroom—where he refused to stand for the judge, refused to plead to the charges, refused to answer questions, refused to consult with his court-appointed attorney, fasted while behind bars, and had to be wheeled into and out from his court appearances because he wouldn’t walk there under his own power.\n\nFor the same reason, upon his conviction, he emphatically said that he was not interested in pursuing an appeal:\n“I said I wanted to file no appeal, nor did I want steps taken to keep the door open, so an appeal could be perfected later.\nI do not recognize any appeal on my behalf…\nMy position is not changed.\nThis is a moral, not a legal, struggle.”\nOne of the lawyers who had been assigned to defend him, however, was convinced that the judge had betrayed bias against McCrackin in his statements from the bench, and said that he intended to disregard his client’s wishes and to appeal anyway.\n\n## Beit Sahour\n\nDuring the Beit Sahour tax strike against the Israeli military occupation, Elias Rishmawi worked to get a suit challenging the legality of the tax accepted by Israel’s court system.\nHe recalled:\n\n> I had never had an illusion that the Israeli supreme court would give any justice to Palestinians.… [But] the appeal formed the legal coverage by which I and others were able to continue resisting from one side not paying taxes, since there is a case in court and they cannot force me pay until the case is solved they cannot take any actions against us since we have this case, and we kept challenging the system through different means.… This was impossible to achieve without the legal coverage of the supreme court. Because then, I and the others, would have been considered as inciters and then might be imprisoned for ten years. That’s why we needed that coverage.\n\n## Halifax “Vicars’ Rate” Resistance\n\nThe movement that grew to resist the “vicars’ rate” in Halifax, England, in 1875–76, was able to exploit a flaw in the carelessly-written law that implemented the rate.\n\nUnder the law’s provisions, the head of the establishment church in Halifax was to periodically summon five churchwardens and tell them to pay him the tax.\nThe chosen five were obligated to pay as asked.\nThey then were to convene a meeting to decide how to recoup this money from the rest of Halifax.\nResisters took advantage of this by attending this meeting and using parliamentary procedure to immediately adjourn it, thus preventing the poor five suckers from recouping their payments.\nThis tactic was only questionably legal, but it nonetheless was effective in continually delaying payment, as it would have been legally cumbersome to compel a meeting to levy the tax against its will.\n\nA witness to a House of Commons committee testified:\n“In nearly every township a meeting of inhabitants has been held; and at every one of these meetings the motion for adjournment has been carried, which means a refusal to lay the rate.”\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Kerr, Gregor [“Lessons from beating the water charges”](http://www.wsm.ie/c/lessons-beating-water-charges%E2%80%941990s)\n* Burns, Danny \u003Ci>Poll Tax Rebellion\u003C/i> AK Press (1992), pp. 71–72, 106&ndash;07, 110, 135&ndash;36, 143\n* Purdie, Ethel Ayres “How the Government Defies the Law” \u003Ci>The Vote\u003C/i> 21 September 1912, p. 974\n* Wilks, Mark “Tax Resistance” \u003Ci>The Vote\u003C/i> 24 September 1910, p. 261\n* Boyle, C.

Between February and May 1990, it was receiving over 200 calls a week.… [Volunteers included] at least five court support workers…\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>They trained volunteers in strategies that they could use to make the legal proceedings work for the benefit of the resisters:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>In every part of England and Wales local groups mobilised to provide support for non-payers in the courts. Tens if not hundreds of activists in each region attended legal briefing sessions. These were run both by activists and sympathetic local lawyers. People were given ideas about how they might disrupt or delay the court proceedings. These included simple things, like asking for a glass of water because their throat was dry, demanding to see the identity cards of everyone present in court, to fainting in court or arranging for fire alarms to go off. People were told to demand their rights to see and read every document which was produced as evidence against them. They were also given briefings on the basic technical arguments.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By October 1990, when most of the court cases had started, virtually every Anti-Poll Tax Union in the UK had trained at least two or three of its members to become conversant with the Poll Tax law. Throughout England and Wales over a thousand people were trained to do court support work and could quote the relevant legislation….\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>With expert oversight, they published a legal guide for resisters:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>[T]he Poll Tax Legal Group… researched legislation and case law. It set up a network of lawyers throughout England and Wales who could support the legal challenges of Anti-Poll Tax groups and produced over 30 accessible legal bulletins on the Poll Tax and a book called \u003Ci>To Pay or Not To Pay\u003C/i>. These underpinned the legal needs of the movement and helped ordinary people to get to grips with the law they needed to use.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>And they successfully fought back by exploiting legal technicalities:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Councils were challenged for sending notices to the wrong addresses. Given the rate at which people moved houses, it was difficult for the councils to keep up, and as a result many cases were dropped because people hadn’t received proper notice. Big legal challenges were also made over “correct procedures.” These came in the first few weeks and resulted mostly from the inexperience of councils in dealing with this sort of process. The first day of Medina Council’s cases (on the Isle of Wight) is probably the most famous example. The reminder notices were sent out with second class stamps, they consequently arrived late, people didn’t receive the statutory notice which they were entitled to, and the court threw out all 1,900 cases. The council had to start again.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>When police attacked an anti-poll tax demonstration in London, many of the demonstrators fought back, and hundreds were arrested.\nSome elements of the campaign leadership distanced themselves from the defendants, worried about the public relations problems of associating the movement with violence.\nSo other activists helped to form and coordinate an independent group—the Trafalgar Square Defendants’ Campaign (TSDC)—with the following mandate:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The campaign will:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Unconditionally defend all of those arrested on March 31st.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Be controlled by and be accountable to the defendants\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Be totally independent of any other organisation.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Seek support from the whole Anti-Poll Tax movement and all other sympathetic organisations.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Seek to co-ordinate the legal defence of all those arrested.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Seek to build a coherent picture of events of 31/3/90 from the point of view of those arrested.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Publicise the points of view of defendants.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Raise money for a bust fund, controlled by the defendants to cover their legal and welfare costs.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Ensure that at all future Anti-Poll Tax events there will be proper legal cover and support for anyone arrested.

They attended every hearing, systematically took notes of everything that was said, recorded the numbers of police officers and approached the defendants asking them to attend the now weekly TSDC meetings… By the summer, over 250 of the defendants had been contacted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The TSDC ran advice sessions on prison, produced legal briefing notes and mailed out the minutes of the weekly meetings to every defendant every week. A solicitors’ group was established with a core of three, but at the peak of early activity they managed to get over fifteen solicitors involved. This proved important because the solicitors’ group managed to get hold of over 50 hours of police videos and handed them over to the campaign. The police videos were crucial in getting a lot of people off, and a number of people in the campaign worked extremely hard editing videos and rejigging them for particular trials. The solicitors’ group also got the Crown Prosecution Service to hand over a full list of all of the defendants and the names and addresses of their lawyers. The lawyers were all contacted and, although many were initially reluctant to cooperate with the campaign, they soon realised that TSDC had a lot of information which their clients needed.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"british-womens-suffrage-movement\">British Women’s Suffrage Movement\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Legal expertise can also help your campaign find flaws in the tax law that you can use to expose it to ridicule.\nFor instance, in 1912 Mark Wilks was arrested and sent to Brixton Prison for failing to pay \u003Cem>his wife’s \u003C/em>income taxes.\nThe case became a \u003Ci>cause célèbre\u003C/i> in the British women’s suffrage movement and an embarrassment to the British government and its tax authorities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ethel Ayres Purdie, a tax law expert with the Women’s Tax Resistance League, discovered the vulnerability.\nThe Income Tax Act, she wrote, “is a most fearsome piece of composition.\nIts language is archaic and tautological, it rises wholly superior to punctuation, and proceeds breathlessly through one hundred and ninety-four clauses.”\nOne of those clauses held a flaw.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/women-taxpayers-agency.gif&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigcaption>an ad for Ethel Ayres Purdie’s “Women Taxpayers’ Agency”\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003Cp>The Married Woman’s Property Act of 1882 was a reform that allowed married women to maintain control of their property rather than relinquishing it to their husbands’ control upon marriage.\nBut the earlier (1842) Income Tax Act still considered the husband to be solely liable for the income taxes of both the husband and wife.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At first, when Elizabeth Wilks began resisting her income tax, the government responded by seizing and selling her property, but when this quirk in the law was discovered, tax resisters like Wilks protested that the government could not legally seize \u003Cem>her\u003C/em> property since as a married woman her taxes were legally owed by the \u003Cem>him\u003C/em> in the marriage.\nSo the government went after Mark Wilks instead and arrested him when he did not pay his wife’s taxes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Mark Wilks insisted that he could hardly fill out an income tax return since he had no legal right to demand information from his wife about her income!\nBesides, his own modest income and lack of property in his own name meant that he could not afford to pay the taxes on his wife’s considerably larger income (he did pay the tax on the portion of their joint income that was attributable to his own income, though his income was low enough that by itself it would not have been taxable).\n“I am informed that I am liable for taxes levied on her income,” he complained, “while at the same time the law places all her property entirely beyond my control.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Meanwhile, the Women’s Tax Resistance League trumpeted the arrest of Mark Wilks and his indefinite imprisonment—“for non-payment of taxes not his own and due on an income over which he has no control and whose amount he can only guess at”—as proving their contention that not only should women resist the income tax, but that married women were not even legally obligated to pay it and those women who were paying it were operating under a legal delusion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The imprisonment of Mark Wilks was a great public relations opportunity:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>For what do the arrest and imprisonment of Mark Wilks mean? We are perfectly certain that it will not last long. Stupid and inept as it has been, the Government, we are certain, will not risk the odium which would justly fall upon it if this outrage on liberty went on. A Government which has much at stake and which lives by the breath of popular opinion cannot afford to ignore such strong and healthy protest as is being poured out on all sides. To us, who are in the midst of it, that which seems most remarkable is the growth of public feeling. In the streets where processions are nightly held, we were met at first by banter and rowdyism. “A man in prison for the sake of Suffragettes!” To the boy-mind of the metropolis, on the outskirts of many an earnest crowd, that seemed irresistibly funny; but thoughtfulness is spreading; into even the boy-mind, the light of truth is creeping. If it had done nothing else, the imprisonment of Mark Wilks has certainly done this—it has educated the public mind.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Wilks was released after less than a month in prison, without receiving any official explanation, and without paying the tax.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"american-war-tax-resisters\">American War Tax Resisters\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Not all legal help is welcome.\nSome resisters prefer to submit passively and unconcernedly to the legal machinations the government puts so much stock in.\nSome such resisters have better things to do with their time and energy than to worry about the minutiae of laws and legal procedures.\nOthers may not want to humor the conceit that a process of justice is taking place around them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For example, when American war tax resister Maurice McCrackin was convicted of refusing to cooperate with an IRS summons, he was following a strategy of complete noncooperation that he kept following right into the courtroom—where he refused to stand for the judge, refused to plead to the charges, refused to answer questions, refused to consult with his court-appointed attorney, fasted while behind bars, and had to be wheeled into and out from his court appearances because he wouldn’t walk there under his own power.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For the same reason, upon his conviction, he emphatically said that he was not interested in pursuing an appeal:\n“I said I wanted to file no appeal, nor did I want steps taken to keep the door open, so an appeal could be perfected later.\nI do not recognize any appeal on my behalf…\nMy position is not changed.\nThis is a moral, not a legal, struggle.”\nOne of the lawyers who had been assigned to defend him, however, was convinced that the judge had betrayed bias against McCrackin in his statements from the bench, and said that he intended to disregard his client’s wishes and to appeal anyway.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"beit-sahour\">Beit Sahour\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>During the Beit Sahour tax strike against the Israeli military occupation, Elias Rishmawi worked to get a suit challenging the legality of the tax accepted by Israel’s court system.\nHe recalled:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>I had never had an illusion that the Israeli supreme court would give any justice to Palestinians.… [But] the appeal formed the legal coverage by which I and others were able to continue resisting from one side not paying taxes, since there is a case in court and they cannot force me pay until the case is solved they cannot take any actions against us since we have this case, and we kept challenging the system through different means.… This was impossible to achieve without the legal coverage of the supreme court.

Within weeks 2,500 households had paid the £2 membership fee, and within 12 months there were over 10,000 paid-up households…\n\n## American War Tax Resisters\n\nAmerican war tax resisters have frequently organized what they call “penalty funds.”\nWith these, a community of resisters and sympathizers come together to pay any penalties & interest that the IRS adds to outstanding taxes that it manages to seize from a resister.\n\nFor example, the “War Tax Resisters Penalty Fund” works this way:\nIf the IRS successfully seizes resisted taxes from a war tax resister, the resister can notify the Fund about the seizure and send documentation showing what portion of what was seized can be attributed to penalties & interest (the portion that was not simply the taxes that the resister had originally refused to pay).\nThe Fund then divides this amount by the number of supporters who have subscribed to the Fund, and sends these supporters a request for that amount.\nThe supporters send in their checks, and the Fund combines these to send a reimbursement to the resister.\n\nThis means that the resister doesn’t lose any more money because of the seizure than they would have lost if they had just paid their taxes in the first place.\n\nThis helps give courage to American war tax resisters who might otherwise be intimidated by the financial impact of penalties & interest imposed by the IRS on unpaid tax amounts.\nIt also helps a wider community to participate in the resistance of an individual resister.\n\n## Chicago Property Tax Strike\n\nYou can use this sort of mutual aid to play offense as well as defense.\nYour campaign can pool money to file lawsuits or injunctions that challenge government enforcement methods or the tax itself.\n\nThe Association of Real Estate Taxpayers (ARET) led a mass property tax strike in Depression-era Chicago.\nThey had 30,000 members who each paid annual dues of $15.\nThis money went to fund lawsuits that challenged a corrupt tax assessment system that had illegally undervalued (or had failed to list) the property of some wealthy and politically-influential landowners.\n\n> By signing up, taxpayers of modest means could secure professional legal service for a grand total of fifteen dollars in fees. The attorney general of Illinois estimated that ARET’s nine suits, if paid for by one person, would cost a total of $200,000! By offering this legal service, ARET put within reach of the ordinary taxpayer an avenue of protest otherwise prohibitive to all but the wealthiest.\n\nA judge agreed with their arguments and invalidated the tax rolls for 1928–30, which made the city unable to collect unpaid property taxes for those years.\n“As the matter stands,” one newspaper account put it, “citizens howled about their taxes, refused to pay them and a court upheld them.\nThey are in revolt with legal sanction.”\n\n## Anti Dray and Land Tax League\n\nCampaigns that organize mutual insurance plans like these may have to make tough decisions about how the plans will be funded and used—for instance, whether the insurance will benefit all resisters, or only those resisters who are also contributors to the mutual insurance fund.\n\nThe Anti Dray and Land Tax League organized a successful tax resistance campaign in South Australia in 1850.\nThey formed a mutual insurance pact during the enthusiasm of the early days of the movement, without putting much thought into the details of how the fund would work.\nThis soon led to internal disputes.\n\nSome thought the fund should be used to legally challenge on the local level every action the government took against every resister (an advocate for this position noted that “the moral force of the League was greatly enhanced by every triumph” in the lower courts).\nOthers thought the fund should instead be used to vigorously appeal one particular test case to the Supreme Court in the hopes of having the tax declared to be invalid.\n\nSome felt that only those who had contributed to the fund should be protected by it, and they put forward a motion: “That no expense be incurred on behalf of any person whose hundred [division] has not contributed £20 to the funds of the League.”\nBut other campaign members opposed the idea that the League’s legal help would be restricted to dues-paying members.\nThey believed that this would discourage the poorer members from resisting, and that because these dues would themselves resemble a tax, it “would savour strongly of the principle they were associated to oppose” and “would be a worse tyranny” than the tax they had associated to fight.\n\n## The Breton Association\n\nThe Breton Association organized tax resistance in the waning days of Charles X’s reign in France in 1829.\nThey were more deliberate and precise when they established their mutual insurance fund, as you can see from their pledge:\n\n> 1. To subscribe individually for ten francs… [and] to pay the same money on presentation of the drafts of Procurators-general, in case they should be named conformably to the third article of the present declaration.\n> 1. This subscription will form a common stock or fund for all Brittany, destined to indemnify the subscribers for any expense they may be put to by their refusal to pay any illegal contributions imposed upon the public…\n> 1. In case of any illegal change in the mode of elections, or any illegal establishment of the taxes, two proxies of each district will assemble at Pontivy, and as soon as they are twenty in number, they will have power to elect amongst the subscribers three procurators-general and an under-procurator in each of the five departments.\n> 1. The duty of the general procurators will be to receive the subscriptions, to afford indemnities conformably to the second article, at the request of any subscriber prosecuted for the payment of illegal contributions; to sue in his name through the sub-procurator of his department for justice against the exactors by all possible means allowed by law; and to become the accusers of all those who are accomplices or abettors of the establishment of illegal taxes.\n> 1. The subscribers named and proxies of this district [are] to assemble with the proxies of the other districts, and to deposit the present subscription in the hands of the general procurators.\n\nSuch precision made it clear to subscribers what they were subscribing to and how decisions were to be made about the use of the mutual insurance fund.\nThis made it less likely that the Association’s work would be distracted by arguments like those that came up in the Anti Dray and Land Tax League.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Kerr, Gregor [“Lessons from beating the water charges”](http://www.wsm.ie/c/lessons-beating-water-charges—1990s)\n* I am a subscriber to the war tax resisters penalty fund, and I made an application for reimbursement of $813 in penalties and interest in 2009.

If it was wrong in the one case, it must be equally wrong, and a violation of principle, in the other. It has surprised us that not one of the Dissenting Journals that we have met with has taken this view of the subject. In their joyfulness at the liberation of the prisoners, they seem to have lost sight entirely of the \u003Cem>sacrifice of principle\u003C/em> at which it was obtained.\n\nAmerican war tax resister Juanita Nelson was arrested one morning for contempt of court (she refused to provide records to the IRS) and was hauled off to jail in her bathrobe.\nShe explains how she accommodated her friends’ desires to help, while remaining faithful to her principles:\n\n> [W]hen the deputy interrupted my reverie to announce visitors, whom I could see in the waiting room, I told him I would leave only to be released.…\n> \n> Two fellow pacifists, one of them also a tax refuser, had been permitted to come to me, since I would not go to them. I asked them what was uppermost in my mind, what they’d do about getting properly dressed? They said that this was something I would have to settle for myself. I sensed that they thought it the better part of wisdom and modesty for me to be dressed for my appearance in court. They were more concerned about the public relations aspect of getting across the witness than I was. They were also genuinely concerned, I knew, about making their actions truly nonviolent, cognizant of the other person’s feelings, attitudes, and readiness. I was shaken enough to concede that I would like to have my clothes at hand, in case I decided I would feel more at ease in them. The older visitor, a dignified man with white hair, agreed to go for the clothes in a taxicab.\n>\n> They left, and on their heels came another visitor. She had been told that in permitting her to come up, the officials were treating me with more courtesy than I was according them. It was her assessment that the chief deputy was hopeful that someone would be able to hammer some sense into me and was willing to make concessions in that hope. But he had misjudged the reliance he might place in her—she was not as critical as the men. She did not know what she would do, but she thought she might wish to have the strength and the audacity to carry through in the vein in which I had started.\n>\n> And she said. “You know, you look like a female Gandhi in that robe. You look, well, dignified.”\n>\n> That was my first encouragement. Everyone else had tended to make me feel like a fool of the first water, had confirmed fears I already had on that score. My respect and admiration for Gandhi, though not uncritical, was deep. And if I in any way resembled him in appearance I was prepared to try to emulate a more becoming state of mind. I reminded myself, too, that I had on considerably more than the loincloth in which Gandhi was able to greet kings and statesmen with ease. I need not be unduly perturbed about wearing a robe into the presence of his honor.\n\n![licensed from “Icebar1” under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license](../../../assets/juanita-nelson.gif)\n\u003Cfigcaption>Juanita Nelson in front of her Deerfield, Massachusetts home\u003C/figcaption>\n\nNelson decided not to contribute to the pretense of courtroom dignity by changing clothes.\nShe appeared before the judge in the same bathrobe she’d been arrested in.\n(The government later dropped the contempt charge against her, without explanation.)\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* “A Recent Imprisonment in Connecticut” \u003Ci>The British Friend\u003C/i> 1 February 1875, p. 33\n* Thoreau, Henry David [“Resistance to Civil Government”](https://sniggle.net/TPL/index5.php?entry=rtcg) (1849)\n* “Pensioner prepared to go to jail” \u003Ci>BBC News\u003C/i> 20 June 2005\n* “‘Terrified’ pensioner jailed over £53 tax bill” \u003Ci>Daily Mail\u003C/i> 26 September 2005\n* Sidley, Marguerite A. “Welsh Campaign” \u003Ci>The Vote\u003C/i> 29 October 1910, p. 5\n* “Baillie Stott, and the Edinburgh Annuity Tax” \u003Ci>The British Friend\u003C/i> 31 August 1848, p. 210\n* Nelson, Juanita “A Matter of Freedom” in \u003Ci>We Won’t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader\u003C/i> (2008) pp. 451–461.\n\n\u003C/details>","src/content/docs/tacticsthatsupportresisters/paytheirfines.md",[2970,2971],"../../../assets/zerah-whipple.gif","../../../assets/juanita-nelson.gif","fb32fed94afe3aae",{"html":2974,"metadata":2975},"\u003Cp>If your campaign has not established any formal mutual insurance plan (see form mutual insurance pacts) to protect individual resisters from fines, penalties, and legal fees that might result from their resistance, people who sympathize with the movement can still show their support by contributing in a more ad hoc, spontaneous fashion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"nick-hogan\">Nick Hogan\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Nick Hogan, a Bolton pub-owner, defied a new anti-smoking ordinance and openly permitted his patrons to light up.\nFor this he was fined £3,000, and another £7,000 in court costs.\nHe refused to pay and was thrown in jail.\nHogan was set free the following month when an anonymous man, dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask and cape, delivered a suitcase full of cash to the prison to pay Hogan’s fine.\nThe funds had been donated by thousands of people around the world who were sympathetic to Hogan’s fight.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"american-war-tax-resisters\">American War Tax Resisters\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/zerah-whipple.gif&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigcaption>Zerah C.

I asked them what was uppermost in my mind, what they’d do about getting properly dressed? They said that this was something I would have to settle for myself. I sensed that they thought it the better part of wisdom and modesty for me to be dressed for my appearance in court. They were more concerned about the public relations aspect of getting across the witness than I was. They were also genuinely concerned, I knew, about making their actions truly nonviolent, cognizant of the other person’s feelings, attitudes, and readiness. I was shaken enough to concede that I would like to have my clothes at hand, in case I decided I would feel more at ease in them. The older visitor, a dignified man with white hair, agreed to go for the clothes in a taxicab.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They left, and on their heels came another visitor. She had been told that in permitting her to come up, the officials were treating me with more courtesy than I was according them. It was her assessment that the chief deputy was hopeful that someone would be able to hammer some sense into me and was willing to make concessions in that hope. But he had misjudged the reliance he might place in her—she was not as critical as the men. She did not know what she would do, but she thought she might wish to have the strength and the audacity to carry through in the vein in which I had started.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And she said. “You know, you look like a female Gandhi in that robe. You look, well, dignified.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That was my first encouragement. Everyone else had tended to make me feel like a fool of the first water, had confirmed fears I already had on that score. My respect and admiration for Gandhi, though not uncritical, was deep. And if I in any way resembled him in appearance I was prepared to try to emulate a more becoming state of mind. I reminded myself, too, that I had on considerably more than the loincloth in which Gandhi was able to greet kings and statesmen with ease. I need not be unduly perturbed about wearing a robe into the presence of his honor.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../../assets/juanita-nelson.gif&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;licensed from “Icebar1” under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cfigcaption>Juanita Nelson in front of her Deerfield, Massachusetts home\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003Cp>Nelson decided not to contribute to the pretense of courtroom dignity by changing clothes.\nShe appeared before the judge in the same bathrobe she’d been arrested in.\n(The government later dropped the contempt charge against her, without explanation.)\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>“A Recent Imprisonment in Connecticut” \u003Ci>The British Friend\u003C/i> 1 February 1875, p. 33\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Thoreau, Henry David \u003Ca href=\"https://sniggle.net/TPL/index5.php?entry=rtcg\">“Resistance to Civil Government”\u003C/a> (1849)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“Pensioner prepared to go to jail” \u003Ci>BBC News\u003C/i> 20 June 2005\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“‘Terrified’ pensioner jailed over £53 tax bill” \u003Ci>Daily Mail\u003C/i> 26 September 2005\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Sidley, Marguerite A. “Welsh Campaign” \u003Ci>The Vote\u003C/i> 29 October 1910, p. 5\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“Baillie Stott, and the Edinburgh Annuity Tax” \u003Ci>The British Friend\u003C/i> 31 August 1848, p. 210\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Nelson, Juanita “A Matter of Freedom” in \u003Ci>We Won’t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader\u003C/i> (2008) pp. 451–461.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/details>",{"headings":2976,"localImagePaths":2984,"remoteImagePaths":2985,"frontmatter":2986,"imagePaths":2988},[2977,2980,2981],{"depth":54,"slug":2978,"text":2979},"nick-hogan","Nick Hogan",{"depth":54,"slug":301,"text":302},{"depth":54,"slug":2982,"text":2983},"when-paying-a-resisters-fines-is-no-help","When Paying a Resister’s Fines is No Help",[2970,2971],[],{"title":2962,"description":2963,"sidebar":2987},{"order":694},[2970,2971],"tacticsthatsupportresisters/petitionforleniency",{"id":2989,"data":2991,"body":2997,"filePath":2998,"digest":2999,"rendered":3000},{"title":2992,"description":2993,"editUrl":16,"head":2994,"template":52,"sidebar":2995,"pagefind":16,"draft":39},"Petition for Leniency towards Resisters","Try to convince the government to be lenient toward resisters.",[],{"order":1301,"hidden":39,"attrs":2996},{},"Another way some campaigns have supported tax resisters has been to try to convince the government to be lenient toward them.\n\nWhen a number of young Quaker men were imprisoned for failure to pay a militia exemption tax in 1778, David Cooper followed them to jail and met with the officers who were holding them captive.\nHe wrote:\n\n> I had much conversation with them; they appeared very moderate, but were very earnest for me to pay the fine, and not suffer our sons to be committed to prison.

However I do not exercise other duties, responsibilities, and privileges of citizenship for my employees. I do not vote for them, I do not form political opinions for them, I do not select a church for them, I do not pay real estate taxes for them. They are all free American citizens, thoroughly capable of performing all of the duties and responsibilities of citizenship for themselves. And so, from this day, I am not collecting nor paying their income taxes for them.\n\nTo demonstrate that she wasn’t against her employees paying their taxes, but only opposed to having to do it for them, she organized her employees once per quarter and allowed them, on company time, to fill out their own tax returns and to go down to the post office as a group to purchase money orders and file their own taxes.\n\nThe U.S. government was not impressed with this gesture.\nIt subjected Kellems to a public smear campaign (they even intercepted her love letters and released them to the press), and to legal action.\nThe government won in court and fined Kellems $7,600, whereupon she resumed withholding taxes from her employees’ paychecks.\n\n## British Women’s Suffrage Movement\n\nThe National Insurance Act of 1911 required all workers in the U.K. to pay a portion of their paychecks into a fund for government-run health and unemployment benefits.\nMembers of the women’s suffrage movement saw this as yet another tax enacted without their consent—another example of “taxation without representation” and another opportunity to resist.\n\nSome suffrage activists could resist as employers, and some suffrage groups could help their own employees to resist.\nKate Harvey, for example, refused to pay the tax on her gardener’s wages, and was sentenced to two months in prison for her refusal.\nThe Women’s Freedom League refused to pay the tax for its employees, saying “we refuse to acquiesce in any legislation which controls the resources of women without the consent of women.”\n\n## Quakers\n\nThe Philadelphia Yearly Meeting (of Quakers) believes that it has “a religious duty to refrain from taking action that violates an employee’s expression of conscience.”\nSo if an employee requests it, the Meeting will hold “the military portion” of the income tax withheld from his or her paycheck in an escrow account, and will inform the government that it will only relinquish the money to them “at such time as there is assurance that the taxes will not be used for military purposes” (see also put your taxes in an escrow account in lieu of payment).\n\n## Pacifist Groups\n\nIn 1956, Ralph DiGia, who was working for the War Resisters League, asked them to stop withholding federal taxes from his paycheck.\nThe League agreed, and some of its other employees followed DiGia’s lead.\nIt had taken a lot of work to get the League to adopt a policy of tax refusal.\nAt first, they had refused.\nA member of the League’s executive committee, afraid of government retribution, said “the life of the organization is at stake.”\nWar tax resisters responded:\n“If pacifist organizations, whose business is to create a warless world, are not ready to risk something for war resistance now, when will they be ready?”\n\nAnother group, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, decided that it was not willing to challenge the IRS in this way, and some of its employees resigned as a result.\n\nFor five years, War Resisters International refused to turn over to the government a portion of the taxes withheld from its resisting employees’ wages.\nBut in 2013, when the group heard that the government was preparing to seize its office equipment over the tax debt, it gave up the fight—though not without trying to turn its surrender into an opportunity to stage a protest.\n\n## Indianapolis Baptist Temple\n\nEmployers who resist legally mandated tax withholding are taking a risk.\nThe Indianapolis Baptist Temple started refusing to withhold federal taxes in 1983, when pastor Gregory Dixon “decided the church would break all ties with the government and no longer act as its agent in withholding taxes from its employees,” citing Constitutional freedom of religion as his mandate for taking his church out from under Uncle Sam’s thumb.\nFor several years, nothing came of this defiance, but in the early 1990s, the IRS started seeking back taxes, and eventually filed liens against the church and against Dixon.\nThe church fought back in court, but lost a series of appeals, and was finally rebuffed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2001, whereupon the government seized and auctioned off church property and Dixon himself was fined.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Kellems, Vivien \u003Ci>Toil, Taxes, and Trouble\u003C/i> (1952), which reproduces the transcript of a speech Kellems gave to the Los Angeles Rotary Club on 13 February, 1948, from which this excerpt is taken\n* Underwood, Florence A.

their property.\n\n## The Kehler/Corner Home\n\nWhen the home of war tax resisters Randy Kehler and Betsy Corner was seized for back taxes, supporters came from near and far to maintain a ’round-the-clock occupation of the home:\n\n> [David] Dellinger and others have come from as far away as California to the Colrain [Massachusetts] house… Mr. Kehler and Ms. Corner continued to live in the house until they were arrested by Federal marshals last December [1991]. Since then, friends and supporters of the couple have arrived to occupy the almost empty house in week-long shifts marked by the Thursday “changing of the guard” ceremony. Because the house was sold in a Government auction in February, all who go inside risk arrest for trespassing.…\n>\n> For Bonney Simons of St. Johnsbury, Vt., sleeping on a bedroll in the house is her first official act of civil disobedience. At 72 years of age, she said, it is time to “put your body where your mouth is.”\n\n## The Siege of Montefiore\n\nBritish women’s suffrage tax resister Dora Montefiore barricaded her home and prevented the tax collector from seizing her property for several weeks in 1906, in what came to be known as the “Siege of Montefiore.” She noted:\n\n> The tradespeople of the neighbourhood were absolutely loyal to us besieged women, delivering their milk and bread, etc., over the rather high garden wall… The weekly wash arrived in the same way and the postman day by day delivered very encouraging budgets of correspondence, so that practically we suffered very little inconvenience…\n>\n> A woman sympathiser in the neighbourhood brought during the course of the [first] morning, a pot of home-made marmalade, as the story had got abroad that we had no provisions and had difficulty in obtaining food. This was never the case as I am a good housekeeper and have always kept a store cupboard, but we accepted with thanks the pot of marmalade because the intentions of the giver were so excellent.\n\nExamples like these proved to be vivid anecdotes that the press could use when they described the siege and the support the besieged women were receiving from sympathizers.\n\n## Valentine Byler\n\nWhen the U.S. government seized Amish tax resister Valentine Byler’s horses and their harnesses while he was in the field preparing for spring planting, sympathetic neighbors allowed him to borrow their horses so he could continue his work.\nOther supporters around the country who heard about the case sent Byler money—more than enough to buy a new team.\n\n## Cosmas Raimondi\n\nWhen war tax resister Cosmas Raimondi’s car was seized by the IRS in 1982, several families in his parish offered to loan him their cars so he could still get around.\n“I’ve not had to ask one person,” he said.\n“I’m beginning to wonder why I even had a car.”\n\n## Halifax “Vicars’ Rate” Resistance\n\nDuring the 1875–76 resistance to the “vicars’ rate” in Halifax, England, when the Anti-Vicars’ Rate Union formed, its president recalled, “two resolutions were passed, the first supporting the formation of the Union, its object being the total and unconditional repeal of the Act [that instituted the rate]; and the second resolution being that of a preliminary guarantee fund of not less than £1,000 be formed to support any poor man who should suffer from the spoiling of his goods under distraint.”\n\n## Rebecca Riots\n\nThe Rebecca Rioters in Wales were more assertive.\nThey sometimes assisted resisters by thwarting the government’s attempts at property seizure:\n\n> Warrants of distress were issued… The constables then went towards Talog; but when on their way there they heard the sound of a horn, and immediately between two and three hundred persons assembled together, with their faces blackened, some dressed in women’s caps, and others with their coats turned so as to be completely disguised—armed with scythes, crowbars, and all manner of destructive weapons which they could lay their hands on. After cheering the constables, they defied them to do their duty. The latter had no alternative but to return to town without executing their warrants.…\n>\n> At Maesgwenllian near Kidwelly, several bailiffs were put in possession for arrears of rent to the amount of £150, but about one o’clock on the morning of 11th September, Rebecca and a great number of her followers made their appearance on the premises, and after driving the bailiffs off, took away the whole of the goods distrained on. As soon as daylight appeared, the bailiffs returned, but found no traces of Rebecca, nor of the goods which had been taken away.\n\n## Moral Support for War Tax Resisters\n\nSometimes, on the other hand, moral support is all that is called for.\nWhen the IRS seized and auctioned off the home and farm of Art Harvey and Elizabeth Gravalos in 1996, other war tax resisters and supporters were by their sides:\n\n> “I might have cried if I were alone,” Gravalos admitted. But she was far from alone. About 75 supporters gathered outside the building and spoke of their solidarity with Elizabeth and Arthur.\n\nIn 1997, the IRS levied 78-year-old war tax resister Ruth McKay’s social security checks to recoup the taxes she had been refusing to pay over the previous twenty years.\nTo show their support of her stand, forty sympathizers joined her for a vigil at the federal courthouse in Concord, New Hampshire.\n\nWhen war tax resister Maria Smith’s wages were garnisheed by the IRS in 2005, fifty supporters held a special church service in her honor.\n\n## Bardoli Tax Strike\n\nOne alternative to a solemn service or vigil is a \u003Cem>party\u003C/em>.\nOne man whose property was seized by the government during the Bardoli tax strike in 1928, and “who thus lost all his valuable property, celebrated the event by inviting friends and soldiers of Satyagraha to a party.”\n\n## Quakers\n\nIf you’re resisting taxes in a good cause or for a good principle, and you know that government retribution is to be expected as part of the package, a property seizure isn’t necessarily cause for panic or mourning, or reason for your friends to take pity on you, but may instead be an opportunity to reflect with satisfaction on a job well done.\n\nIn 1822, Nathaniel Morgan was speaking with someone who was curious about Quaker practices and he remembered the conversation this way:\n\n> I told him then that I and my father had refused to pay the income tax on account of war, and had refused it on its first coming out, and withstood it 16 years, except when peace was declared, and that our goods were sold by auction to pay it.

how about 40? 30? 20? 10?\nHe managed to negotiate God down to ten before God got sick of the act and walked away.\nAlas, there weren’t even that many righteous people, so God torched the place.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For that matter, Thoreau’s note that in his speech to a mostly-shocked crowd “the seed has not all fallen in stony &#x26; shallow ground” also has Biblical roots, as does his “do not let your right hand know what your left hand does” remark.\nEven if you’re not a Christian, you almost have to be familiar with the King James Bible just to acquire the vocabulary of metaphors you need to understand the centuries of English-language literature that came after.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By using phrases like these and drawing on the stories they evoked in his audience, Thoreau is reminding them that his arguments, while challenging, are rooted in a tradition they can understand and already are familiar with.\nAs good Christians, they have probably already tried to imagine the Kingdom of God as being like a little yeast leavening a whole loaf, or whether or not they are the sort of good ground on which the seeds of good teaching would land and flourish, or whether if angels came to destroy their town they would be among the ten righteous people who could argue for them to spare it.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Hennacy, Ammon “The Old Pioneer” \u003Ci>The Book of Ammon\u003C/i> (1970) p. 92\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Hennacy, Ammon “We Have the Kind of World We Deserve” \u003Ci>The Book of Ammon\u003C/i> (1970) p. 196–98\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Hennacy, Ammon “Culls” \u003Ci>The Book of Ammon\u003C/i> (1970) p. 233\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Thoreau.

Moreover, any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already.” (Thoreau, H.D. “Resistance…” op. cit.)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Arendt, Hannah \u003Ci>Eichmann in Jerusalem\u003C/i> (2006 ed.) p. 233\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/details>",{"headings":3260,"localImagePaths":3261,"remoteImagePaths":3262,"frontmatter":3263,"imagePaths":3265},[],[],[],{"title":3249,"description":3250,"sidebar":3264},{"order":230},[],"therevolutioniswithinyou/introduction",{"id":3266,"data":3268,"body":3273,"filePath":3274,"digest":3275,"rendered":3276},{"title":134,"description":3269,"editUrl":16,"head":3270,"template":52,"sidebar":3271,"pagefind":16,"draft":39},"Perhaps, contrary to what the organizers of the world tell us, the key to curing society’s ills is not necessarily to organize at all.",[],{"order":96,"hidden":39,"attrs":3272},{},"> I sent you once a song with the refrain:\n>\n>  Let me be the one\u003Cbr />\n>  To do what is done\n>\n> …You see the beauty of my proposal is\u003Cbr />\n> It needn’t wait on general revolution.\u003Cbr />\n> I bid you to a one-man revolution\u003Cbr />\n> The only revolution that is coming.\n\nIn Robert Frost’s poem “Build Soil,” from which the above excerpt is taken, he complains of friends who “crowd around me with their five year plans,” and he gives this advice to the listener:\n\n> Don’t join too many gangs.

The position of the bees on the branch is temporary, and must inevitably be changed. They must start off and find themselves a habitation. Each of the bees knows this, and desires to change her own and the others’ position, but no one of them can do it till the rest of them do it. They cannot all start off at once, because one hangs on to another and hinders her from separating from the swarm, and therefore they all continue to hang there. It would seem that the bees could never escape from their position, just as it seems that worldly men, caught in the toils of the state conception of life, can never escape. And there would be no escape for the bees, if each of them were not a living, separate creature, endowed with wings of its own. Similarly there would be no escape for men, if each were not a living being endowed with the faculty of entering into the Christian conception of life.\n> \n> If every bee who could fly did not try to fly, the others, too, would never be stirred, and the swarm would never change its position. And if the man who has mastered the Christian conception of life would not, without waiting for other people, begin to live in accordance with this conception, mankind would never change its position. But only let one bee spread her wings, start off, and fly away, and after her another, and another, and the clinging, inert cluster would become a freely flying swarm of bees. Just in the same way, only let one man look at life as Christianity teaches him to look at it, and after him let another and another do the same, and the enchanted circle of existence in the state conception of life, from which there seemed no escape, will be broken through.\n> \n> But men think that to set all men free by this means is too slow a process, that they must find some other means by which they could set all men free at once. It is just as though the bees who want to start and fly away should consider it too long a process to wait for all the swarm to start one by one; and should think they ought to find some means by which it would not be necessary for every separate bee to spread her wings and fly off, but by which the whole swarm could fly at once where it wanted to. But that is not possible; till a first, a second, a third, a hundredth bee spreads her wings and flies off of her own accord, the swarm will not fly off and will not begin its new life. Till every individual man makes the Christian conception of life his own, and begins to live in accord with it, there can be no solution of the problem of human life, and no establishment of a new form of life.710\n\nSometimes, a single personal revolutionary really does change the world.\nMaybe the world was already ripe for changing, but it still needed a personal revolutionary to break from the pack and make the change happen.\n\nWhat became known as the Coventry “tithe war” began modestly, with one solitary revolutionary taking flight and inviting the rest of the hive to join him.\nA contemporary newspaper account, trying to explain to its readers where this sudden uprising came from, was able to trace its roots to this one person who was willing to be thought eccentric even by his allies, waiting for them to realize he was taking the lead:\n\n> A few individual citizens have maintained a consistent protest against a tax which they declared offended their consciences, and one tradesman, whose goods have been distrained year after year, has retaliated with equal regularity by issuing handbills setting forth his woes, and the rapacity of what he was wont to describe as “Mother Church.” The leading Nonconformists, and it may be said the Nonconformists as a body, have until lately refrained from all open sympathy with this suffering brother, whose controversial tactics were generally regarded as somewhat wanting in good taste. In the Autumn of last year the annual testimony borne in this quarter attracted more attention than usual in consequence of an open-air indignation meeting by which it was followed. The meeting was by no means influentially attended, and it was not believed at the time that it would have any important consequences. It led, however, to the formation of an Anti-Vicars’ Rate Association, whose action has brought about the present crisis.\n\nHennacy says the self-transforming doers like Christ, the Buddha, Gandhi, or Joan of Arc were far more radical than theorizers like Marx or Bakunin.\nThoreau would agree (though his own list—“Minerva, Ceres, Neptune, Prometheus, Socrates, Christ, Luther, Columbus, Arkwright”—was a little more ethereal).\n“I know of few radicals as yet who are radical enough,” he said, “and have not got this name rather by meddling with the exposed roots of innocent institutions than with their own.”\n\nHumankind doesn’t progress by passively absorbing the inevitable bounty of history grinding away unconsciously on the masses, as the Hegelians might have it.\nRather, says Thoreau, “The great benefactors of their race have been single and singular and not masses of men.\nWhether in poetry or history it is the same.”\nWe should not be content to admire these heroes, or to await their arrival, but should be inspired by their examples to each be as heroic as we can.\n\n> The gods have given man no constant gift, but the power and liberty to act greatly. How many wait for health and warm weather to be heroic and noble! We are apt to think there is a kind of virtue which need not be heroic and brave—but in fact virtue is the deed of the bravest; and only the hardy souls venture upon it, for it deals in what we have no experience, and alone does the rude pioneer work of the world.\n\n> Action from principle,—the perception and the performance of right,—changes things and relations; it is essentially revolutionary, and does not consist wholly with any thing which was. It not only divides states and churches, it divides families; aye, it divides the individual, separating the diabolical in him from the divine.\n\n> There is something proudly thrilling in the thought that this obedience to conscience and trust in God, which is so solemnly preached in extremities and arduous circumstances, is only to retreat to one’s self, and rely on our own strength. In trivial circumstances I find myself sufficient to myself, and in the most momentous I have no ally but myself, and must silently put by their harm by my own strength, as I did the former. As my own hand bent aside the willow in my path, so must my single arm put to flight the devil and his angels. God is not our ally when we shrink, and neuter when we are bold. If by trusting in God you lose any particle of your vigor, trust in Him no longer.… I cannot afford to relax discipline because God is on my side, for He is on the side of discipline.\n\nWe can’t all be Christ, Buddha, Gandhi, or Joan of Arc.\n(Steve Allen said that Ammon Hennacy was more of a Lenny Bruce-style character; Hennacy’s wife suggested that Don Quixote might be a better match.)\nIt is only one-in-a-million who moves the world, but despite the odds we all should aspire to be this one in a million.\nHennacy put it this way:\n\n> Love without courage and wisdom is sentimentality, as with the ordinary church member. Courage without love and wisdom is foolhardiness, as with the ordinary soldier. Wisdom without love and courage is cowardice, as with the ordinary intellectual. Therefore one who has love, courage, and wisdom is one in a million who moves the world, as with Jesus, Buddha, and Gandhi.\n\nIf we choose this goal, even if we fall short, we not only choose the only goal worth choosing, but we adjust our standards so that if we are ever lucky enough to meet this one in a million, we will be more likely to recognize her or him.\nMost people are incapable of recognizing or comprehending the hero in real life—we lionize the dead martyred heroes of past generations, but join the lynch mobs to martyr the heroes of our own.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Tolstoy, Leo “The Kingdom of God Is Within You” (Constance Garnett translation, 1894), pp. 214–15\n* “Coventry’s Church War” \u003Ci>New York Times\u003C/i> 29 September 1882 (reprinted from the \u003Ci>London Times\u003C/i>)\n* Hennacy, Ammon “A Final Word from the Author” \u003Ci>The Book of Ammon\u003C/i> (1970) front matter\n* Thoreau.

But there are also disadvantages.",[],{"order":75,"hidden":39,"attrs":3372},{},"The advantage of organizing and working together, in theory anyway, is the greater force that comes from superior numbers.\nBut there are also disadvantages: It takes time and negotiation and coordination to get a bunch of people to take action together, and usually this also means you have to find some lowest common denominator of principle or risk that everyone can agree on.\nThis can mean that you water down the core of what you’re fighting for until it seems less like a principle than a petty grievance—and once you’ve done that, it may not seem to be as worth fighting for.\n\nIn this way a movement risks gaining numbers at the expense of losing passion.\nAny force it gains from numbers it may lose from the diffuse, blunted, half-hearted effort of the individuals that make it up, or from the fact that much of their energy is expended on the organizing itself rather than on the ostensible goals of the organization.\n\nThe advantage of drawing a large crowd of half-hearted followers may not be worth the effort.\nIt is not too hard to sway a crowd of wishy-washy people by appealing to the half-truths they already believe and being careful not to attack any of the nonsense they adhere to.\nBut what does this get you?\nA crowd of wishy-washy people who are just as vulnerable to falling for the next demagogue who comes along with patronizing speeches.\nInstead, Hennacy recommends, we should “appeal to those about ready to make the next step and… know that these are very few indeed.”\n\nWhen Thoreau was invited to give a speech he refused to water down his message to make it palatable to his listeners.\nHe wasn’t aiming for the sympathy of the crowd, but he hoped to reach those one or two people who were ready to be challenged.\nHe was amused at the response to one of his talks:\nThe “craven priest” who had invited him to speak was “looking for a hole to escape at” and there was “an awful silence” in the audience.\n“But,” he reflected, “the seed has not all fallen in stony & shallow ground.”\n\nThoreau noted with approval that the abolitionist revolutionary John Brown had \u003Cem>not\u003C/em> gathered around him a large party of well-wishers and collaborators, but instead had been very selective about whom he let in on his plans:\n\n> I hear many condemn these men because they were so few. When were the good and the brave ever in a majority?

Accept responsibility and act responsibly.\n1. Build yourself a glass house and start throwing stones.\n\n## Accept Responsibility and Act Responsibly\n\nMost political action amounts to “who can we find to take responsibility for this problem”—but the Personal Revolutionary asks “what is \u003Cem>my\u003C/em> responsibility?”\n\nNot that everything is your responsibility, or that the world is looking to you personally to solve all of its problems.\nBut you should at the very least examine your life to see what problems or solutions you are contributing to.\nCan one person make a difference?\nYou are \u003Cem>already\u003C/em> making a difference—the real question is: what kind of difference are you making?\nAs Thoreau put it:\n\n> It is not a man’s duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the eradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still properly have other concerns to engage him, but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to give it practically his support. If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man’s shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too.…\n\n> A man has not every thing to do, but something; and because he cannot do \u003Cem>every thing\u003C/em>, it is not necessary that he should do \u003Cem>something\u003C/em> wrong.\n\nIn Thoreau’s time, the evils of slavery and of wars of conquest were sustained by the active allegiance and support of the ordinary people around him, many of whom nonetheless congratulated themselves for their anti-war, anti-slavery opinions.\nSo he did not address his protest to the government, but to his neighbors:\n\n> I quarrel not with far-off foes, but with those who, near at home, cooperate with, and do the bidding of those far away, and without whom the latter would be harmless.…\n>\n> I have heard some of my townsmen say, “I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico,—see if I would go;” and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute. The soldier is applauded who refuses to serve in an unjust war by those who do not refuse to sustain the unjust government which makes the war.…\n>\n> Those who, while they disapprove of the character and measures of a government, yield to it their allegiance and support, are undoubtedly its most conscientious supporters, and so frequently the most serious obstacles to reform. Some are petitioning the State to dissolve the Union, to disregard the requisitions of the President. Why do they not dissolve it themselves,—the union between themselves and the State,—and refuse to pay their quota into its treasury?…\n>\n> If a thousand men were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible.\n\nDon’t be fooled into thinking that because the personal revolution is in your heart that it can just stay there, locked up inside, without leaking out into the world around you:\n\n> As to conforming outwardly, and living your own life inwardly, I have not a very high opinion of that course. Do not let your right hand know what your left hand does in that line of business. I have no doubt it will prove a failure.\n\nThe personal revolution doesn’t \u003Cem>necessarily\u003C/em> require living in opposition to society and the status quo, but it does require holding fast to justice and virtue.\nWhen society and the status quo try to put you in opposition to justice and virtue, as they so often do, this puts them in opposition to you as well, and you to them.\n\n## Build Yourself a Glass House and Start Throwing Stones\n\nYour friends and even your enemies will come to your aid when you try to hold yourself to a high standard.\nAll you have to do is to make yourself vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy.\nPeople love to point out hypocritical moralists, in part because some hypocritical moralists are hilarious, but also in part because it helps people excuse their own failure to hold themselves to a high standard.\nIf you build yourself a glass house and throw stones from it, everyone will volunteer to keep you on the straight-and-narrow.\n\nHennacy:\n\n> I have… put myself in a glass house. If so I must needs take whatever stones come my way. I have the right by my life of integrity to criticize, but I must also take whatever criticism comes my way in all good humor.…\n>\n> [A] spoiled and arrogant priest wanted to know if I was “holier than thou.” I told him I hoped by Christ I was, for if I wasn’t I would be in a hell of a fix. I used this blunt method to deflate his spurious piety.\n\n> At times those who do not want to have their inconsistencies pointed out say in a super-sweet voice to me “judge not, lest ye be judged.” I reply, “O.K., judge me, then.”\n\nWhen your standards for yourself rise, so do your standards for other people (otherwise you really \u003Cem>are\u003C/em> being arrogant).\nThoreau, criticized for demanding too much from people, said he could not “convince myself that I have any right to be satisfied with men as they are, and to treat them accordingly, and not according, in some respects, to my requisitions and expectations of what they and I ought to be.”\n\nWhile both Thoreau and Hennacy strike me as having been stern with others, and maybe not always fun to be around (as Hennacy said: “I love my enemies but am hell on my friends”), they were anything but joyless.\nThoreau’s vigorous, enthusiastic love of life is legendary, and Hennacy’s character too was eager, life-affirming, and generous (even in its criticisms).\n\nUtah Phillips came home from the Korean war a drunken brawler.\nHe checked in to Hennacy’s Catholic Worker hospitality house in Salt Lake City, and eight years later checked out again—sober, a pacifist, and an anarchist.\nHe remembered Hennacy this way:\n\n> He was tough without being hard—tough without that brittle hardness that some tough men have that would shatter if you struck it too hard. “Love in Action,” Dorothy Day called him—Dostoyevsky’s words: “Love in action is harsh and dreadful compared to love in dreams.”\n\nNeither Thoreau nor Hennacy had any tolerance for bliss-bunnyishness, but both were cheerful; both knew how to be dutiful without being dour.\nThoreau:\n\n> To march sturdily through life, patiently and resolutely looking grim defiance at one’s foes, that is one way; but we cannot help being more attracted by that kind of heroism which relaxes its brows in the presence of danger, and does not need to maintain itself strictly, but, by a kind of sympathy with the universe, generously adorns the scene and the occasion, and loves valor so well that itself would be the defeated party only to behold it; which is as serene and as well pleased with the issue as the heavens which look down upon the field of battle. It is but a lower height of heroism when the hero wears a sour face.…\n>\n> A great cheerfulness indeed have all great wits and heroes possessed, almost a profane levity to such as understood them not, but their religion had the broader basis of health and permanence. For the hero, too, has his religion, though it is the very opposite to that of the ascetic. It demands not a narrower cell but a wider world.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n\u003Cdetails>\n\u003Csummary>Notes and Citations\u003C/summary>\n\n* Thoreau, H.D.

Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially falseness to yourself. Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every hour, every minute. Avoid being scornful, both to others and to yourself. What seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of your observing it in yourself. Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the consequence of every sort of falsehood. Never be frightened at your own faint-heartedness in attaining love. Don’t be frightened overmuch even at your evil actions. I am sorry I can say nothing more consoling to you, for love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams. Love in dreams is greedy for immediate action, rapidly performed and in the sight of all. Men will even give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon over, with all looking on and applauding as though on the stage. But active love is labour and fortitude, and for some people too, perhaps, a complete science.\n* Thoreau, H.D.

war tax resistance movement, which includes resisters from each of these four categories, each with their own distinct motives and goals.\nThis has made it difficult for this movement to unite around particular tactics.\n\nLet me show you what I mean by introducing four fictional American war tax resisters who represent these varieties:\n\n**Amy**\n: Amy is a Quaker pacifist.\n  “From an ethical point of view,” she says, “I don’t see much difference between firing a weapon at somebody and paying somebody else to fire it.”\n  She also wants to be a law-abiding citizen, however, and so the method of tax resistance that most appeals to her is to reduce her income to the point where she no longer owes federal income tax.\n  This allows her to be comfortable with her conscience without breaking the law and risking legal sanctions.\n  For her, the lower standard of living is a small price to pay for this peace of mind.\n\n**Brian**\n: Brian has marched in protest rallies and linked arms with other anti-war protesters in civil disobedience blockades, but he thinks tax resistance is the best way to make himself heard.\n  “Money talks.\n  Stop paying your taxes and the government will have to stop ignoring you.”\n  Brian refuses to pay 50% of his federal income tax, a percentage he believes is roughly equivalent to the portion of income tax revenue that the government spends on militarist projects.\n  When taxes are due, he includes a letter with his tax return explaining his refusal, and he sends copies of his letter to his Congressional representatives and to his local newspaper.\n  When the government responds by adding interest and fines to his tax bill and seizing the money from his bank account, he uses the occasion to send out another press release about his action and why he feels it is important.\n\n**Clara**\n: The bumper sticker on Clara’s car reads “It’ll be a great day when our schools get all the money they need and the Air Force has to hold a bake sale to buy a bomber.”\n  She’s trying to make this day come to pass by persuading the members of a national progressive group she volunteers for to withhold their taxes from the government and redirect the money to schools themselves.\n  “If the government won’t use our tax dollars responsibly, we’ll just have to show them how it’s done,” she says.\n  “But to make this work, we need a lot of people to join us, and we need to be very practical in choosing techniques that really work to deprive the military-industrial complex of resources.”\n\n**Donald**\n: Donald notes that many conscientious objectors to military service had to risk prison (or even execution) before the government acknowledged that conscientious objectors have a right not to participate in war.\n  He hopes that his tax resistance will help persuade the government to acknowledge that this right also extends to taxpayers who are conscientiously opposed to paying for war.\n  He lobbies the government, asking it to create a “Peace Tax Fund” where conscientious taxpayers could deposit their taxes without fear that the money would be used for military spending.\n  Meanwhile he is pursuing a court appeal in which he asserts conscientious objection to military taxation is a Constitutional right.\n  “I would be happy to pay every cent I owe, even more,” he says, “if only I knew my money were not paying for war.”\n\nAmy, Brian, Clara, and Donald may sit in the same circle at a war tax resistance gathering.\nThey may take inspiration from some of the same exemplars and authors.\nYou may see them marching together and signing the same petitions.\nThey have a lot in common.\n\nBut because they have different motives and different goals, they may find it hard to rally around a common tactic or campaign.\n\nFor instance, when Brian thinks about Amy’s quiet, legal resistance, he wonders how she thinks she’s going to persuade the government to change its policies that way.\nBut Amy thinks, “I don’t refuse to kill people because I think that my refusal will be an effective protest against murder, but because it would be wrong for me to murder.\nThat’s also how I feel about my taxes.”\n\nClara thinks of Brian’s experience of having his bank account raided each year by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and wonders how Brian thinks he’s having any impact on military spending with such a strategy.\nBut Brian doesn’t have any ambitions of defunding the government.\nHe still hopes to persuade it to change, and thinks that an uncompromising position of total opposition would be neither persuasive nor successful.\n\nAmy looks at Donald’s lobbying and wonders why it is so important to him that the government legalize his conscience—isn’t conscience compelling enough without needing a law to agree with it?\nBut Donald hopes that legalizing conscientious objection will give it more respect and visibility, and will encourage more people to consider a question of conscience that only brave dissidents are willing to consider today.\nThe state of the law is a way of measuring society’s values, he thinks, and if the law recognizes conscientious objection to military taxation, this may mean that society is that much more willing to recognize dissent from war as a proper role for its citizens.\n\nSuperficially these activists are all “war tax resisters”—using a similar tactic, with similar motives, and similar goals in mind.\nBut when you look a little closer you notice that their motives have important differences, their goals are not the same after all, and that therefore the tactics that are appropriate for one might not be appropriate for another.\n\nDoes your campaign include multiple varieties of resister?\nIf so, you will need to be sensitive to these different aspirations, and not assume that a tactic that is attractive to some will seem compelling (or even sensible) to all.\n\nYou may look at some of the tactics in this book and think “what possible good could that do?”\nIf so, remind yourself that different tactics are best for different goals, and consider that a tactic that looks useless to you may still have some use to another variety of resister.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n## Notes and Citations\n\n* Zahn, Franklin “Tax Refusal, Law, and Order” \u003Ci>Friends Journal\u003C/i> 1 October 1967, pp. 514–15 (“We refuse to steal not as

of goals in mind.\nThis book examines many tactics that have been used to augment tax resistance campaigns, but some of these are only appropriate for some varieties of tax resister and will only help to meet the goals of some types of resistance campaign.\nWhat sort of tax resister are you?\nWhat are the goals your campaign hopes to accomplish?\nYou need to put some thought into those questions before you can choose tactics that are appropriate for your campaign.\n\nIn this chapter you will learn about four common varieties of tax resister and what their goals are.\nYou’ll also learn what you can do if your campaign contains resisters from more than one category who, as a result, may have a hard time agreeing on tactics.\nAs an example of such a conundrum, I’ll discuss the difficult case of the current American war tax resistance movement, which is challenged by containing resisters from all four categories:\n\n1. the conscientious objector\n1. the protester\n1. the nonviolent resister\n1. the legal challenger\n\n## The Conscientious Objector\n\nTax resisters who are motivated by conscientious objection are profoundly opposed to the unethical activities of the government.\nThey feel that to pay taxes would make them \u003Cem>participants\u003C/em> in these activities.\nThey consider the risks of tax resistance to be worth taking because they believe the risks of behaving unethically are worse.\n\nThe classic example of this is a pacifist who is unwilling either to take up a weapon to kill in war, or to pay for somebody else to do so by paying a war tax.\n\nThe goal of conscientious objectors is to wash their hands of complicity.\nSuch resisters don’t necessarily care if the government knows about their resistance, and don’t necessarily feel like they need to be part of a movement.\nResisting taxes is itself the right thing to do, they feel, and they would resist even if they were alone in doing so and even if nobody else were aware that they were resisting.\n\nHenry David Thoreau explained his tax resistance in the language of a conscientious objector:\n\n> It is not a man’s duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the eradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still properly have other concerns to engage him; but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to give it practically his support. If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man’s shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, “I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico,—see if I would go;” and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute.\n\n## The Protester\n\nPeople who resist their taxes as a form of protest, on the other hand, very much want others to know about what they are doing.\nThey want to amplify their complaint by publicly breaking the law and inviting the legal consequences.\nThis communicates the strength of their objections and their willingness to sacrifice and take risks for these beliefs.\n\nIf the government responds to their tax resistance by seizing the tax money from them, that doesn’t necessarily represent a defeat to protesters, since their tax resistance is more about taking a principled oppositional stand than about the actual money involved.\n\nFor example, tax resisters in the women’s suffrage movement in Great Britain wanted to demonstrate the self-serving hypocrisy of a male-exclusive government that treated women as people when it came time to tax them, but as non-people when it came time to ask for the consent of the governed.\nThese resisters openly defied the government and dared it to arrest them or seize their property—and then used any such reprisals as opportunities for further protest. They were civil-disobedient protesters, and their tactics reflect this.\n\n## The Nonviolent Resister\n\n“Withholding payment of taxes is one of the quickest methods of overthrowing a government,” said Gandhi.\nResisters who hope to reduce the resources available to the government and thereby force it to change its behavior (or perhaps even to weaken and then overthrow it), are using tax resistance as a form of nonviolent conflict.\nSuch resisters need lots of comrades to join in the struggle, and they prefer those tactics that cost the government the most.\n\nFor example, tax resisters in the movement pressing for the Reform Act of 1832 in Great Britain wanted to “stop the supplies”—that is, to withhold enough money from the government that it would be crippled and would be forced to grant the movement’s demands.\nThis is why they augmented their tax strike with a run on the Bank of England.\nThey were using tax resistance as part of a campaign of nonviolent conflict meant to force political change.\n\n## The Legal Challenger\n\nSome tax resisters resist because they conclude that the tax they are resisting was enacted illegally, is being imposed by an institution without the proper authority to do so, or is being illegally applied to them in particular.\nThey resist in anticipation of such a legal theory being found to be correct, and for the tax to be legally abolished.\n\nFor example, property tax resisters in Depression-era Chicago refused to pay while they pursued a legal challenge to property assessments that had left many wealthy and well-connected property owners exempt.\n(They won their case, which found the assessments—and therefore the taxes based on them—to be invalid.)\n\n## Resisters from Multiple Categories\n\nSome resisters belong to more than one category.\nFor instance, a tax resister may be initially motivated by conscientious objection, but may then hope to also make their tax resistance a public protest.\nOr a resistance campaign may believe a tax to be illegal and it may advise people to resist on that account, while also believing that if enough people resist, this will help to force the government to acknowledge their legal interpretation.\n\nThere is some natural overlap between the varieties of resister I have mentioned.\nIt’s possible for your campaign to include resisters with motives and goals from multiple varieties, without this being confusing or causing problems.\n\nBut I’ve also noticed some tax resisters get confused.\nThey believe they can “mix and match” tactics and rhetoric from various categories without giving much attention to whether their mix makes for a coherent recipe.\nFor example, I’ve noticed some war tax resisters who use the rhetoric of conscientious objection when they explain the motives for their resistance, but who then back this up by choosing \u003Cem>symbolic\u003C/em> tactics (like resisting only a certain percentage of their tax) that are more appropriate to someone who is resisting as a form of protest and that wouldn’t meet the goals of a true conscientious objector.\n\nBecause confused tax resisters like these have disconnects between their motives, tactics, and goals, they are less effective in meeting their goals and also less convincing when they try to get support or sympathy for their stand.\n\n\u003Chr />\n\n## Notes and Citations\n\n* Thoreau, H.D.

If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man’s shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is tolerated.
